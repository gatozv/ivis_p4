  <description>This new book by Lise Bourbeau demonstrates that all problems, whether physical, emotional or mental, stem from five important wounds: rejection, abandonment, humiliation, betrayal and injustice. This book contains detailed descriptions of these wounds and of the masks we've developed to hide them. With this information, you will learn to identify the real cause of a specific problem in your life. You will also discover why some of us are extremely thin and others extremely fat, what other clues our physical bodies provide, and even how the way we dance can give us an insight into our particular wounds and masks. This book will allow you to set off on the path that leads to complete healing, the path that leads to your ultimate goal: your true self. Lise Bourbeau is also author of the International Best-Selling title, Listen to Your Body, Your Best Friend on Earth.</description>

  <description>Forget everything you thought you knew about how to motivate people—at work, at school, at home. It's wrong. As Daniel H. Pink (author of&lt;em&gt; To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others&lt;/em&gt;) explains in his paradigm-shattering book &lt;em&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt;, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does—and how that affects every aspect of our lives. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century, it's precisely the &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; way to motivate people for today's challenges. In &lt;em&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt;, he reveals the three elements of true motivation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;—the desire to direct our own lives&lt;br&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Mastery&lt;/strong&gt;—the urge to get better and better at something that matters&lt;br&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt; is bursting with big ideas—the rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live.</description>

  <description>A young woman walks into a laboratory. Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketers at Procter &amp;amp; Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;They succeeded by transforming habits.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Power of Habit, &lt;/em&gt;award-winning &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;At its core, &lt;em&gt;The Power of Habit&lt;/em&gt; contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.</description>

  <description>In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;He was the stuff erotic dreams are made of&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Salon owner Julie Stanford wanted Nathan Tucker ever since she gave him his first massage. Getting paid to feel every inch of his body, stripped, oiled, and spread out in front of her. Stuff dreams are made of. But the sexy guy was oblivious to the signals she was sending; until she finished off his final rub-down with something extra. In fact, the best extra he ever had. Unfortunately, he came around too late. Now Julie's moving on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She was &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; he'd dreamed of&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The woman was driving him crazy.  She lit fire to his insides then ran like a scalded cat.  And now she's going to someone else to have all her fantasies fulfilled? Over his dead body. He's more than willing to give her what she wants, and as soon as he pins the little minx down, he'd show her his own brand of sweet seduction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's all fun and games until someone falls in love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The man of her dreams would give the orders.  For him, she had two words that satisfied them both...&lt;em&gt;"Take me."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For five years, Serena has run Fantasy Incorporated and has devoted her time to fulfilling her clients' fantasies. Never her own. Until now...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her most secret desire is to give ownership of her body to a man. Someone who will command her, pleasure her, and have complete authority over her. So she seeks out Damon Roche, owner of an exclusive sex club and a man strong enough to make her do anything he wants. &lt;em&gt;Anything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together they'll journey into a world she's only dreamed of. She's given the opportunity to immerse herself in a different life while her normal one waits for her to return whenever she wishes. Damon has no desire to let her go, however. Serena is the woman he's long searched for, and it's up to him to convince her to stay when the game is all over with. He wants their fantasy to become their reality and for Serena to remain his pampered, cherished submissive.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Under Faith Malone's deceptively soft exterior lies a woman who knows exactly what she wants: a strong man who'll take without asking—because she's willing to give him everything...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dallas cop Gray Montgomery is on a mission: find the guy who killed his partner and bring him to justice. So far, he's found a link between the killer and Faith—and if Gray has to get close to her to catch the killer, so be it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faith is sweet and feminine, everything Gray wants and desires in a woman, but he suspects she's playing games. No way would she allow a man to call the shots in their relationship. Or would she?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faith sees in Gray the strong, dominant man she needs, but he seems determined to keep her at a distance. So she takes matters into her own hands to prove to him it's no game she's playing. She's willing to surrender to the right man. Gray would like to be that man.  But catching his partner's killer has to be his first priority—until Faith is threatened and Gray realizes he will do anything to protect her...</description>

  <description>Ash, Jace, and Gabe: three of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the country. They’re accustomed to getting anything they want. Anything at all. For Ash, it’s the woman who changes everything he’s ever known about dominance and desire...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to sex, Ash McIntyre has always explored his wilder side — extreme and uncompromising. He demands control. And he prefers women who want it like that. Even the women he’s shared with his best friend, Jace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Jace is involved with a woman he has no intention of sharing. And now even Gabe has settled into a relationship with a woman who gives him everything he needs, leaving Ash feeling restless and unfulfilled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Ash meets Josie, who seems immune to his charms and his wealth. Intrigued, he begins a relentless pursuit, determined she won’t be the one who got away. He never imagined the one woman to tell him no would be the only woman who’d ever drive him to the edge of desire.</description>

  <description>Gabe, Jace, and Ash: three of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the country. They’re accustomed to getting anything they want. Anything at all. For Gabe, it’s making one particular fantasy come true with a woman who was forbidden fruit. Now she’s ripe for the picking...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Gabe Hamilton saw Mia Crestwell walk into the ballroom for his hotel’s grand opening, he knew he was going to hell for what he had planned. After all, Mia is his best friend’s little sister. Except she’s not so little anymore. And Gabe has waited a long time to act on his desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabe has starred in Mia’s fantasies more than once, ever since she was a teenager with a huge crush on her brother’s best friend. So what if Gabe’s fourteen years older? Mia knows he’s way out of her league, but her attraction has only grown stronger with time. She’s an adult now, and there’s no reason not to act on her most secret desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Gabe pulls her into his provocative world, she realizes there’s a lot she doesn’t know about him or how exacting his demands can be. Their relationship is intense and obsessive, but as they cross the line from secret sexual odyssey to something deeper, their affair runs the risk of being exposed—and vulnerable to a betrayal far more intimate than either expected.</description>

  <description>Jace, Ash, and Gabe: three of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the country. They’re accustomed to getting anything they want. Anything at all. For Jace, it’s a woman whose allure takes him completely by surprise...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jace Crestwell, Ash McIntyre, and Gabe Hamilton have been best friends and successful business partners for years. They’re powerful, they’re imposing, they’re irresistibly sexy, and Jace and Ash share everything—including their women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When they meet Bethany, Jace begins to feel things he’s never experienced before: jealousy, and a powerful obsession that threatens him, overwhelms him—and excites him beyond control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jace isn’t sharing Bethany—with anyone. He’s determined to be the only man in her life, and it’s jeopardizing a lifelong friendship with Ash. Bethany will be his and his alone. Even if it means turning his back on his best friend.</description>

  <description>Delightfully smart and heartbreakingly poignant, Allison Pearson’s smash debut novel has exploded onto bestseller lists as “The national anthem for working mothers.” Hedge-fund manager, wife, and mother of two, Kate Reddy manages to juggle nine currencies in five time zones and keep in step with the Teletubbies. But when she finds herself awake at 1:37 a.m. in a panic over the need to produce a &lt;em&gt;homemade &lt;/em&gt;pie for her daughter’s school, she has to admit her life has become unrecognizable. With panache, wisdom, and uproarious wit,&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I Don’t Know How She Does It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;brilliantly dramatizes the dilemma of every working mom.</description>

  <description>An angry rebel, John dropped out of school and enlisted in the Army, not knowing what else to do with his life--until he meets the girl of his dreams, Savannah. Their mutual attraction quickly grows into the kind of love that leaves Savannah waiting for John to finish his tour of duty, and John wanting to settle down with the woman who has captured his heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But 9/11 changes everything. John feels it is his duty to re-enlist. And sadly, the long separation finds Savannah falling in love with someone else. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear John&lt;/em&gt;, the letter read... and with those two words, a heart was broken and two lives were changed forever. Returning home, John must come to grips with the fact that Savannah, now married, is still his true love—and face the hardest decision of his life.</description>

  <description>Ever since legwarmers were cool, best friends Tara, Katherine, and Fintan have survived small-town ennui, big-city heartbreak, and endless giddy nights out on the town. But now that they've graduated to their slightly more serious thirties, only Fintan has what can honestly be called a "love life." With Tara struggling daily with her eternal diet—and her dreadful, penny-pinching boyfriend—and Katherine keeping her single existence as organized as her drawer full of matching bra and panty sets, it seems they'll never locate the exit door out of the "last chance saloon."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it's always when you are least ready for change that fate insists on one. And when catastrophe inevitably follows crisis, the lives of three best friends are sure to change in unexpected ways ... and not necessarily for the worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You devoured the hilarious antics of Claire in &lt;em&gt;Watermelon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;You laughed 'til you cried in &lt;em&gt;Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;You took a vacation gone mad in &lt;em&gt;Rachel's Holiday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;You flew away with Margaret—good girl gone bad—in &lt;em&gt;Angels&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;You got a peek inside the cutthroat world of women's fashion magazines in &lt;em&gt;Sushi for Beginners&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, raise your glass to Tara, Katherine, and Fintan in &lt;em&gt;Last Chance Saloon&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Lou Clark knows lots of things. She knows how many footsteps there are between the bus stop and home. She knows she likes working in The Buttered Bun tea shop and she knows she might not love her boyfriend Patrick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Lou doesn't know is she's about to lose her job or that knowing what's coming is what keeps her sane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Traynor knows his motorcycle accident took away his desire to live. He knows everything feels very small and rather joyless now and he knows exactly how he's going to put a stop to that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Will doesn't know is that Lou is about to burst into his world in a riot of colour. And neither of them knows they're going to change the other for all time.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;About three things I was absolutely positive:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, there was a part of him - and I didn't know how dominant that part might be - that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bella Swan moves to the gloomy town of Forks and meets Edward Cullen, her life takes a thrilling and terrifying turn. With his porcelain skin, golden eyes, mesmerizing voice, and supernatural gifts, Edward is both irresistible and impenetrable. Up until now, he has managed to keep his true identity hidden, but Bella is determined to uncover his dark secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Bella doesn't realize is the closer she gets to him, the more she is putting herself and those around her at risk.

  <description>What happens when a psychic tells Lucy that she'll be getting married within the year? Her roommates panic! What is going to happen to their blissful existence of eating take-out, drinking too much wine, bringing men home, and never vacuuming?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucy reassures her friends that she's far too busy arguing with her mother and taking care of her irresponsible father to get married. And then there's the small matter of not even having a boyfriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then Lucy meets gorgeous, unreliable Gus. Could he be the future Mr. Lucy Sullivan? Or could it be handsome Chuck? Or Daniel, the world's biggest flirt? Or even cute Jed, the new guy at work?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe her friends have something to worry about after all....</description>

  <description>Every April, when the wind blows from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did You Know?-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Jamie was named after Nicholas's editor, Jamie Raab?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Landon is the name of his third son?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Nicholas Sparks recorded his own reading for the audio version of the novel?&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Edwards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This Prada-wearing magazine editor thinks her life is over when her "fabulous" new job turns out to be a deportation to Dublin to launch &lt;em&gt;Colleen&lt;/em&gt; magazine. The only saving grace is that her friends aren't there to witness her downward spiral. Might her new boss, the disheveled and moody Jack Devine, save her from a fate worse than hell?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashling Kennedy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashling, &lt;em&gt;Colleen&lt;/em&gt;'s assistant editor, is an award-winning worrier, increasingly aware that something fundamental is missing from her life -- apart from a boyfriend and a waistline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clodagh "Princess" Kelly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashling's best friend, Clodagh, lives the domestic dream in a suburban castle. So why, lately, has she had the recurring urge to kiss a frog -- or sleep with a frog, if truth be told? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As these three women search for love, success, and happiness, they will discover that if you let things simmer under the surface for too long, sooner or later they'll boil over.</description>

  <description>Marian Keyes begins &lt;em&gt;Watermelon&lt;/em&gt; with a rather inauspicious romantic opening when the heroine's husband leaves her for Denise from the flat downstairs the day their first child is born. Claire, the deserted wife and mother, returns to her family in Dublin and, after going through the required stages of "Loss, Loneliness, Hopelessness and Humiliation", begins to feel much better--so much better that when James tries to win his way back into her affections, he gets more than he bargained for.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A novel about holding on, letting go, and learning to love again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in paperback, the endearing novel that captured readers' hearts and introduced a fresh new voice in women's fiction Cecelia Ahern.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holly couldn't live without her husband Gerry, until the day she had to. They were the kind of young couple who could finish each other's sentences. When Gerry succumbs to a terminal illness and dies, 30-year-old Holly is set adrift, unable to pick up the pieces. But with the help of a series of letters her husband left her before he died and a little nudging from an eccentric assortment of family and friends, she learns to laugh, overcome her fears, and discover a world she never knew existed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The kind of enchanting novel with cross-generational appeal that comes along once in a great while, &lt;em&gt;PS, I Love You&lt;/em&gt; is a captivating love letter to the world!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>MEET BECKY BLOOMWOOD, AN IRRESISTIBLE HEROINE WITH A BIG HEART, BIG DREAMS --- AND JUST ONE LITTLE WEAKNESS ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Becky Bloomwood has what most twenty-five-year-olds only dream of: a flat in London's trendiest neighborhood, a troupe of glamorous socialite friends, and a closet brimming with the season's must-haves. The only trouble is, she can't actually afford it --- not any of it. Her job writing at &lt;em&gt;Successful Saving&lt;/em&gt; magazine not only bores her to tears, it doesn't pay much at all. Still, how can she resist that perfect pair of shoes? Or the divine silk blouse in the window of that ultra-trendy boutique? But lately Becky's been chased by dismal letters from Visa and the Endwich Bank --- letters with large red sums she can't bear to read --- and they're getting ever harder to ignore. She tries cutting back; she even tries making &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; money. But none of her efforts succeeds. Her only consolation is to buy herself something ... just a little something ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, a story arises that Becky actually &lt;em&gt;cares&lt;/em&gt; about, and her front-page article catalyzes a chain of events that will transform her life --- and the lives of those around her --- forever.</description>

  <description>Lara Lington has always had an overactive imagination, but suddenly that imagination seems to be in overdrive. Normal professional twenty-something young women don’t get visited by ghosts. Or do they?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the spirit of Lara’s great-aunt Sadie—a feisty, demanding girl with firm ideas about fashion, love, and the right way to dance—mysteriously appears, she has one request: Lara must find a missing necklace that had been in Sadie’s possession for more than seventy-five years, because Sadie cannot rest without it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lara and Sadie make a hilarious sparring duo, and at first it seems as though they have nothing in common. But as the mission to find Sadie’s necklace leads to intrigue and a new romance for Lara, these very different “twenties” girls learn some surprising truths from and about each other. Written with all the irrepressible charm and humor that have made Sophie Kinsella’s books beloved by millions, &lt;strong&gt;Twenties Girl&lt;/strong&gt; is also a deeply moving testament to the transcendent bonds of friendship and family. </description>

  <description>I’ve lost it. :( The only thing in the world I wasn’t supposed to lose. My engagement ring. It’s been in Magnus’s family for three generations. And now the very same day his parents are coming, I’ve lost it. The very same day! Do not hyperventilate, Poppy. Stay positive :) !!&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Poppy Wyatt has never felt luckier. She is about to marry her ideal man, Magnus Tavish, but in one afternoon her “happily ever after” begins to fall apart. Not only has she lost her engagement ring in a hotel fire drill but in the panic that follows, her phone is stolen. As she paces shakily around the lobby, she spots an abandoned phone in a trash can. Finders keepers! Now she can leave a number for the hotel to contact her when they find her ring. Perfect!&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Well, perfect except that the phone’s owner, businessman Sam Roxton, doesn’t agree. He wants his phone back and doesn’t appreciate Poppy reading his messages and wading into his personal life.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; What ensues is a hilarious and unpredictable turn of events as Poppy and Sam increasingly upend each other’s lives through emails and text messages. As Poppy juggles wedding preparations, mysterious phone calls, and hiding her left hand from Magnus and his parents . . . she soon realizes that she is in for the biggest surprise of her life.</description>

  <description>How is it possible to know someone you've never met?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With her marriage already in pieces, Joyce Conway nearly lost everything else. But she survived the terrible accident that left her hospitalized--and now, inexplicably, she can remember faces she has never seen, cobblestone Parisian streets she's never visited. A sudden, overwhelming sense of deja vu has Joyce feeling as if her life is not her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Justin Hitchcock's decision to donate blood was the first thing to come straight from his heart in a long time. He chased his ex-wife and daughter from Chicago to London--and now, restless and lonely, he lectures to bored college students in Dublin. But everything is about to change with the arrival of a basket of muffins with a thank-you note enclosed--the first in a series of anonymous presents that will launch Justin into the heart of a mystery . . . and alter two lives forever.</description>

  <description>When twenty-eight-year-old Lexi Smart wakes up in a London hospital, she’s in for a big surprise. Her teeth are perfect. Her body is toned. Her handbag is Vuitton. Having survived a car accident—in a Mercedes no less—Lexi has lost a big chunk of her memory, three years to be exact, and she’s about to find out just how much things have changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somehow Lexi went from a twenty-five-year-old working girl to a corporate big shot with a sleek new loft, a personal assistant, a carb-free diet, and a set of glamorous new friends. And who is this gorgeous husband—who also happens to be a multimillionaire? With her mind still stuck three years in reverse, Lexi greets this brave new world determined to be the person she…well, seems to be. That is, until an adorably disheveled architect drops the biggest bombshell of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly Lexi is scrambling to catch her balance. Her new life, it turns out, comes complete with secrets, schemes, and intrigue. How on earth did all this happen? Will she ever remember? And what will happen when she does?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the same wicked humor and delicious charm that have won her millions of devoted fans, Sophie Kinsella, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Shopaholic &amp;amp; Baby, returns with an irresistible new novel and a fresh new heroine who finds herself in a life-changing and utterly hilarious predicament…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Meet Bridget Jones—&lt;/strong&gt;a 30-something Singleton who is certain she would have all the answers if she could:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;a. lose 7 pounds&lt;br&gt;b. stop smoking&lt;br&gt;c. develop Inner Poise&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;"123 lbs. (how is it possible to put on 4 pounds in the middle of the night? Could flesh have somehow solidified becoming denser and heavier? Repulsive, horrifying notion), alcohol units 4 (excellent), cigarettes 21 (poor but will give up totally tomorrow), number of correct lottery numbers 2 (better, but nevertheless useless)..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridget Jones' Diary&lt;/em&gt; is the devastatingly self-aware, laugh-out-loud daily chronicle of Bridget's permanent, doomed quest for self-improvement — a year in which she resolves to: reduce the circumference of each thigh by 1.5 inches, visit the gym three times a week not just to buy a sandwich, form a functional relationship with a responsible adult, and learn to program the VCR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of the year, Bridget loses a total of 72 pounds but gains a total of 74. She remains, however, optimistic. Through it all, Bridget will have you helpless with laughter, and — like millions of readers the world round — you'll find yourself shouting, "Bridget Jones is me!"</description>

  <description>Meet Emma Corrigan, a young woman with a huge heart, an irrepressible spirit, and a few little secrets: Secrets from her boyfriend: I've always thought Connor looks a bit like Ken. As in Barbie and Ken. Secrets from her mother: I lost my virginity in the spare bedroom with Danny Nussbaum while Mum and Dad were downstairs watching Ben-Hur. Secrets she wouldn't share with anyone in the world: I have no idea what NATO stands for. Or even what it is. Until she spills them all to a handsome stranger on a plane. At least, she thought he was a stranger.…Until Emma comes face-to-face with Jack Harper, the company's elusive CEO, a man who knows every single humiliating detail about her...</description>

  <description>In her early thirties, Elizabeth Gilbert had everything a modern American woman was supposed to want--husband, country home, successful career--but instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she felt consumed by panic and confusion. This wise and rapturous book is the story of how she left behind all these outward marks of success, and of what she found in their place. Following a divorce and a crushing depression, Gilbert set out to examine three different aspects of her nature, set against the backdrop of three different cultures: pleasure in Italy, devotion in India, and on the Indonesian island of Bali, a balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"Oh, screw it, let's do it."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's the philosophy that has allowed Richard Branson, in slightly more than twenty-five years, to spawn so many successful ventures. From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Losing My Virginity is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business, he and his friends decided that "since we're complete virgins at business, let's call it just that: Virgin." Since then, Branson has written his own "rules" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of Richard Branson's companies--airlines, retailing, and cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said, "Don't do it." But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. &lt;br&gt;And in this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in Branson's life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Signing the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil Collins&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishment&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Swimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of Mexico&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selling Virgin Records to save Virgin Atlantic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Staging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And much more. Losing My Virginity is the ultimate tale of personal and business survival from a man who combines the business prowess of Bill Gates and the promotional instincts of P. T. Barnum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also available in the UK from Virgin Publishing, and in Canada from General Publishing,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>
