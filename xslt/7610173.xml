  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Promise Not to Tell&lt;/em&gt; returns with a simmering literary thriller about ghostly secrets, dark choices, and the unbreakable bond between mothers and daughters . . . sometimes &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; unbreakable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; West Hall, Vermont, has always been a town of strange disappearances and old legends. The most mysterious is that of Sara Harrison Shea, who, in 1908, was found dead in the field behind her house just months after the tragic death of her daughter, Gertie. Now, in present day, nineteen-year-old Ruthie lives in Sara's farmhouse with her mother, Alice, and her younger sister, Fawn. Alice has always insisted that they live off the grid, a decision that suddenly proves perilous when Ruthie wakes up one morning to find that Alice has vanished without a trace. Searching for clues, she is startled to find a copy of Sara Harrison Shea's diary hidden beneath the floorboards of her mother's bedroom. As Ruthie gets sucked deeper into the mystery of Sara's fate, she discovers that she's not the only person who's desperately looking for someone that they've lost. But she may be the only one who can stop history from repeating itself.</description>

  <description>In the frigid pre-dawn hours, in a distressed Midwestern city, hundreds of desperate unemployed folks are lined up for a spot at a job fair. Without warning, a lone driver plows through the crowd in a stolen Mercedes, running over the innocent, backing up, and charging again. Eight people are killed; fifteen are wounded. The killer escapes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another part of town, months later, a retired cop named Bill Hodges is still haunted by the unsolved crime. When he gets a crazed letter from someone who self-identifies as the "perk" and threatens an even more diabolical attack, Hodges wakes up from his depressed and vacant retirement, hell-bent on preventing another tragedy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brady Hartfield lives with his alcoholic mother in the house where he was born. He loved the feel of death under the wheels of the Mercedes, and he wants that rush again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only Bill Hodges, with a couple of highly unlikely allies, can apprehend the killer before he strikes again. And they have no time to lose, because Brady’s next mission, if it succeeds, will kill or maim thousands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr. Mercedes is a war between good and evil, from the master of suspense whose insight into the mind of this obsessed, insane killer is chilling and unforgettable.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The founder of Nasty Gal offers a sassy and irreverent manifesto for ambitious young women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At seventeen, Sophia Amoruso decided to forgo continuing education to pursue a life of hitchhiking, dumpster diving, and petty thievery. Now, at twenty-nine, she is the Founder, CEO, and Creative Director of Nasty Gal, a $100+ million e-tailer that draws A-list publicity and rabid fans for its leading-edge fashion and provocative online persona. Her story is extraordinary—and only part of the appeal of &lt;em&gt;#GIRLBOSS&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This aspirational book doesn’t patronize young women the way many business experts do. Amoruso shows readers how to channel their passion and hard work, while keeping their insecurities from getting in the way. She offers straight talk about making your voice heard and doing meaningful work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; She’s proof that you can be a huge success without giving up your spirit of adventure or distinctive style. As she writes, "I have three pieces of advice I want you to remember: Don’t ever grow up. Don’t become a bore. Don’t let The Man get to you. OK? Cool. Then let’s do this.”</description>

  <description>A dazzling, heartbreaking page-turner destined for breakout status: a novel that gives voice to millions of Americans as it tells the story of the love between a Panamanian boy and a Mexican girl: teenagers living in an apartment block of immigrant families like their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After their daughter Maribel suffers a near-fatal accident, the Riveras leave México and come to America. But upon settling at Redwood Apartments, a two-story cinderblock complex just off a highway in Delaware, they discover that Maribel's recovery--the piece of the American Dream on which they've pinned all their hopes--will not be easy. Every task seems to confront them with language, racial, and cultural obstacles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Redwood also lives Mayor Toro, a high school sophomore whose family arrived from Panamà fifteen years ago. Mayor sees in Maribel something others do not: that beyond her lovely face, and beneath the damage she's sustained, is a gentle, funny, and wise spirit. But as the two grow closer, violence casts a shadow over all their futures in America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peopled with deeply sympathetic characters, this poignant yet unsentimental tale of young love tells a riveting story of unflinching honesty and humanity that offers a resonant new definition of what it means to be an American. An instant classic is born.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/em&gt; follows three women, each at a crossroads:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madeline is a force to be reckoned with. She’s funny and biting, passionate, she remembers everything and forgives no one. Her ex-husband and his yogi new wife have moved into her beloved beachside community, and their daughter is in the same kindergarten class as Madeline’s youngest (&lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;is this possible?). And to top it all off, Madeline’s teenage daughter seems to be choosing Madeline’s ex-husband over her. (How. Is. This. Possible?).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Celeste is the kind of beautiful woman who makes the world stop and stare. While she may seem a bit flustered at times, who wouldn’t be, with those rambunctious twin boys? Now that the boys are starting school, Celeste and her husband look set to become the king and queen of the school parent body. But royalty often comes at a price, and Celeste is grappling with how much more she is willing to pay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New to town, single mom Jane is so young that another mother mistakes her for the nanny. Jane is sad beyond her years and harbors secret doubts about her son. But why? While Madeline and Celeste soon take Jane under their wing, none of them realizes how the arrival of Jane and her inscrutable little boy will affect them all.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliant take on ex-husbands and second wives, mothers and daughters, schoolyard scandal, and the dangerous little lies we tell ourselves just to survive.</description>

  <description>Georgie McCool knows her marriage is in trouble; it has been in trouble for a long time. She still loves her husband, Neal, and Neal still loves her, deeply — but that almost seems beside the point now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe that was always beside the point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two days before they’re supposed to visit Neal’s family in Omaha for Christmas, Georgie tells Neal that she can’t go. She’s a TV writer, and something’s come up on her show; she has to stay in Los Angeles. She knows that Neal will be upset with her — Neal is always a little upset with Georgie — but she doesn't expect him to pack up the kids and go home without her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her husband and the kids leave for the airport, Georgie wonders if she’s finally done it. If she’s ruined everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That night, Georgie discovers a way to communicate with Neal in the past. It’s not time travel, not exactly, but she feels like she’s been given an opportunity to fix her marriage before it starts . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is that what she’s supposed to do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or would Georgie and Neal be better off if their marriage never happened?</description>

  <description>If you want to live happily ever after, first you have to stay alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Viv knows there’s no escaping her fairy-tale curse. One day her beautiful stepmother will feed her a poison apple or convince her on-again-off-again boyfriend, Henley, to hunt her down and cut out her heart before she breaks his. In the city of Beau Rivage, some princesses are destined to be prey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then Viv receives an invitation to the exclusive club where the Twelve Dancing Princesses twirl away their nights. There she meets Jasper, an underworld prince who seems to have everything—but what he really wants is her. He vows to save her from her dark fate if she’ll join him and be his queen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Viv has to do is tear herself away from the huntsman boy who still holds her heart. Then she might live to see if happily ever after is a promise the prince can keep. But is life as an underworld queen worth sacrificing the true love that might kill her?</description>

  <description>It begins with a boy. Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Goldfinch&lt;/em&gt; is a novel of shocking narrative energy and power. It combines unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and breathtaking suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is a beautiful, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Road&lt;/em&gt; chronicles Jack Kerouac's years traveling the North American continent with his friend Neal Cassady, "a sideburned hero of the snowy West." As "Sal Paradise" and "Dean Moriarty," the two roam the country in a quest for self-knowledge and experience. Kerouac's love of America, his compassion for humanity, and his sense of language as jazz combine to make &lt;em&gt;On the Road&lt;/em&gt; an inspirational work of lasting importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerouac's classic novel of freedom and longing defined what it meant to be "Beat" and has inspired every generation since its initial publication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>This Fifth Edition is completely revised and expanded to cover JavaScript as it is used in today's Web 2.0 applications. This book is both an example-driven programmer's guide and a keep-on-your-desk reference, with new chapters that explain everything you need to know to get the most out of JavaScript, including:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scripted HTTP and Ajax XML processing Client-side graphics using the canvas tag Namespaces in JavaScript--essential when writing complex programs Classes, closures, persistence, Flash, and JavaScript embedded in Java applications&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part I explains the core JavaScript language in detail. If you are new to JavaScript, it will teach you the language. If you are already a JavaScript programmer, Part I will sharpen your skills and deepen your understanding of the language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part II explains the scripting environment provided by web browsers, with a focus on DOM scripting with unobtrusive JavaScript. The broad and deep coverage of client-side JavaScript is illustrated with many sophisticated examples that demonstrate how to:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Generate a table of contents for an HTML document Display DHTML animations Automate form validation Draw dynamic pie charts Make HTML elements draggable Define keyboard shortcuts for web applications Create Ajax-enabled tool tips Use XPath and XSLT on XML documents loaded with Ajax And much more&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part III is a complete reference for core JavaScript. It documents every class, object, constructor, method, function, property, and constant defined by JavaScript 1.5 and ECMAScript Version 3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part IV is a reference for client-side JavaScript, covering legacy web browser APIs, the standard Level 2 DOM API, and emerging standards such as the XMLHttpRequest object and the canvas tag.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than 300,000 JavaScript programmers around the world have made this their indispensable reference book for building JavaScript applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"A must-have reference for expert JavaScript programmers...well-organized and detailed."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript</description>

  <description>This stunning and elegiac novel by the author of the internationally acclaimed &lt;strong&gt;Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&lt;/strong&gt; has sold over 4 million copies in Japan and is now available to American audiences for the first time.  It is sure to be a literary event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toru, a quiet and preternaturally serious young college student in Tokyo, is devoted to Naoko, a beautiful and introspective young woman, but their mutual passion is marked by the tragic death of their best friend years before.  Toru begins to adapt to campus life and the loneliness and isolation he faces there, but Naoko finds the pressures and responsibilities of life unbearable.  As she retreats further into her own world, Toru finds himself reaching out to others and drawn to a fiercely independent and sexually liberated young woman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A poignant story of one college student's romantic coming-of-age, &lt;strong&gt;Norwegian Wood&lt;/strong&gt; takes us to that distant place of a young man's first, hopeless, and heroic love.</description>

  <description>Everybody gets to be supermodel gorgeous. What could be wrong with that? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tally is about to turn sixteen, and she can't wait. Not for her license - for turning pretty. In Tally's world, your sixteenth birthday brings an operation that turns you from a repellent ugly into a stunningly attractive pretty and catapults you into a high-tech paradise where your only job is to have a really great time. In just a few weeks Tally will be there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Tally's new friend Shay isn't sure she wants to be pretty. She'd rather risk life on the outside. When Shay runs away, Tally learns about a whole new side of the pretty world and it isn't very pretty. The authorities offer Tally the worst choice she can imagine: find her friend and turn her in, or never turn pretty at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The choice Tally makes changes her world forever...</description>

  <description>Ninety-five days, and then I'll be safe. I wonder whether the procedure will hurt. I want to get it over with. It's hard to be patient. It's hard not to be afraid while I'm still uncured, though so far the deliria hasn't touched me yet. Still, I worry. They say that in the old days, love drove people to madness. The deadliest of all deadly things: It kills you both when you have it and when you don't.</description>

  <description>Ellie Watt is used to starting over. The daughter of a grifting team, Ellie spent her childhood being used as a pawn in her parents' latest scam. Now she’s much older, wiser and ready to give her con artist life a rest. But returning to the dry desert town of Palm Valley, California means one more temptation than she bargained for – Camden McQueen. Once known as the high school weirdo, Camden is bigger and badder than the boy he used to be and a talented tattoo artist with his own thriving business. Ellie’s counting on Camden still being in love with her but what she’s not counting on is how easily unrequited love can turn into obsession over time. When Camden discovers Ellie’s plan to con him, he makes her a deal she doesn’t dare refuse, but her freedom comes with a price and it’s one that takes both Ellie and Camden down a dangerous road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***The Artists Trilogy is a dark and sexy contemporary ride about three flawed individuals caught in a world where it's so easy to justify the bad things we do. This is a pure adult read (Not YA or NA).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the 1st book in the trilogy. It is followed by the novella On Every Street (released in March 2013) and the sequel Shooting Scars (released in May 2013). The third and final book in the series will also be released October 15, 2013.***</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“My life was complete. Happy, content, everything neat and perfect.&lt;br&gt;Then it all changed.&lt;br&gt;I was sold.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tess Snow has everything she ever wanted: one more semester before a career in property development, a loving boyfriend, and a future dazzling bright with possibility. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For their two year anniversary, Brax surprises Tess with a romantic trip to Mexico. Sandy beaches, delicious cocktails, and soul-connecting sex set the mood for a wonderful holiday. With a full heart, and looking forward to a passion filled week, Tess is on top of the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But lusty paradise is shattered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kidnapped. Drugged. Stolen. Tess is forced into a world full of darkness and terror. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Captive and alone with no savior, no lover, no faith, no future, Tess evolves from terrified girl to fierce fighter. But no matter her strength, it can’t save her from the horror of being sold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Brax find Tess before she’s broken and ruined, or will Tess’s new owner change her life forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A New Adult Dark Contemporary Romance, not suitable for people sensitive to grief, slavery, and nonconsensual sex. A story about finding love in the strangest of places, a will of iron that grows from necessity, and forgiveness that may not be enough.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>An unlikely bond is forged between three men from very different backgrounds when they serve time together in prison.  A series of wrong turns and disastrous life choices has led to their incarceration. Following their release, Mangle, Decker and Tazeem stick together as they return to a life of crime, embarking on a lucrative scam. But when they stumble upon a sophisticated sex-trafficking operation, they soon realise that they are in mortal danger.  The disappearance of a family member and the murder of a dear friend lead the three to delve deeper into a world of violence and deception. In their quest for retribution and justice, they put their lives on the line. Their paths cross with that of Tatiana, who has left her home country for a better life in the West - or so she thinks. She soon realises she is in the hands of ruthless, violent people, who run an operation supplying girls to meet the most deviant desires of rich and powerful men.  Will she survive the horrors of The Zombie Room? Are Mangle, Decker and Tazeem brave enough to follow her there, in an attempt to set her free?</description>

  <description>Pulsing with the dark obsession of Radiohead’s song “Creep,” this taut thriller—Jennifer Hillier’s superb debut—rockets from its seductive opening to a heartpounding climax not easily forgotten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If he can’t have her . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Sheila Tao is a professor of psychology. An expert in human behavior. And when she began an affair with sexy, charming graduate student Ethan Wolfe, she knew she was playing with fire. Consumed by lust when they were together, riddled with guilt when they weren’t, she knows the three-month fling with her teaching assistant has to end. After all, she’s finally engaged to a kind and loving investment banker who adores her, and she’s taking control of her life. But when she attempts to end the affair, Ethan Wolfe won’t let her walk away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;. . . no one else can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethan has plans for Sheila, plans that involve posting a sex video that would surely get her fired and destroy her prestigious career. Plans to make her pay for rejecting him. And as she attempts to counter his every threatening move without her colleagues or her fiancé discovering her most intimate secrets, a shattering crime rocks Puget Sound State University: a female student, a star athlete, is found stabbed to death. Someone is raising the stakes of violence, sex, and blackmail . . . and before she knows it, Sheila is caught in a terrifying cat-and-mouse game with the lover she couldn’t resist—who is now the monster who won’t let her go.</description>

  <description>When young, pretty Catherine Bailey meets Lee Brightman, she can't believe her luck. Gorgeous, charismatic, and a bit mysterious, Lee seems almost too perfect to be true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what begins as flattering attention and spontaneous, passionate sex transforms into raging jealousy, and Catherine soon discovers that Lee's dazzling blue eyes and blond good looks hide a dark, violent nature. Disturbed by his increasingly erratic, controlling behavior, she tries to break it off; turning to her friends for support, she's stunned to find they don't believe her. Increasingly isolated and driven into the darkest corner of her world, a desperate Catherine plans a meticulous escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Four years later, Lee is behind bars and Catherine—now Cathy—is trying to build a new life in a new city. Though her body has healed, the trauma of the past still haunts her. Then Stuart Richardson, her attractive new neighbor, moves in. Encouraging her to confront her fears, he sparks unexpected hope and the possibility of love and a normal life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until the day the phone rings . . .</description>

  <description>Lou Clark knows lots of things. She knows how many footsteps there are between the bus stop and home. She knows she likes working in The Buttered Bun tea shop and she knows she might not love her boyfriend Patrick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Lou doesn't know is she's about to lose her job or that knowing what's coming is what keeps her sane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Traynor knows his motorcycle accident took away his desire to live. He knows everything feels very small and rather joyless now and he knows exactly how he's going to put a stop to that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Will doesn't know is that Lou is about to burst into his world in a riot of colour. And neither of them knows they're going to change the other for all time.</description>

  <description>Her mother named her Esperanza Salvación - Hope for Salvation. But when a girl works as an escort for Colombian cartel in the ghettos of Spanish Harlem, there wasn’t much hope, or salvation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope’s telepathic ability keeps her a step ahead of ruin, but her unusual gift attracts the attention of a psychotic vampire bitch. Trapped in a Manhattan penthouse with the psycho, she thought she was dead meat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her survival lies in the hands of Vampire Master Enrique. He seems to respect her, perhaps even care. As a measure of protection, he makes her his personal Bloodslave. Helplessly addicted to his bite, Enrique rules her every moment. As always, Hope must adapt to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Swept into the decadent nightlife of Manhattan's elite, she falls in love with Enrique and prays someday he may grow to love her, too. But is it simply a relationship of convenience? Is she nothing more than a concubine desperate to satisfy his nightly demands for blood and sex?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And forever in the background is the fear that one day the cartel boss she abandoned will hunt her down to collect on old debts.</description>

  <description>In her early thirties, Elizabeth Gilbert had everything a modern American woman was supposed to want--husband, country home, successful career--but instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she felt consumed by panic and confusion. This wise and rapturous book is the story of how she left behind all these outward marks of success, and of what she found in their place. Following a divorce and a crushing depression, Gilbert set out to examine three different aspects of her nature, set against the backdrop of three different cultures: pleasure in Italy, devotion in India, and on the Indonesian island of Bali, a balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence.</description>

  <description>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled "quiet," it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Gogh’s sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, &lt;em&gt;Quiet &lt;/em&gt;shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the reader on a journey from Dale Carnegie’s birthplace to Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the twentieth century and explores its far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of American business culture, where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation, and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and introverts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps most inspiring, she introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Finally, she offers invaluable advice on everything from how to better negotiate differences in introvert-extrovert relationships to how to empower an introverted child to when it makes sense to be a "pretend extrovert."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This extraordinary book has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how introverts see themselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Riley Blackthorne just needs a chance to prove herself—and that’s exactly what the demons are counting on...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Riley, the only daughter of legendary Demon Trapper, Paul Blackthorne, has always dreamed of following in her father's footsteps. The good news is, with human society seriously disrupted by economic upheaval and Lucifer increasing the number of demons in all major cities, Atlanta’s local Trappers’ Guild needs all the help they can get—even from a girl. When she’s not keeping up with her homework or trying to manage her growing crush on fellow apprentice, Simon, Riley’s out saving distressed citizens from foul-mouthed little devils – Grade One Hellspawn only, of course, per the strict rules of the Guild. Life’s about as normal as can be for the average demon-trapping teen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then a Grade Five Geo-Fiend crashes Riley’s routine assignment at a library, jeopardizing her life and her chosen livelihood. And, as if that wasn’t bad enough, sudden tragedy strikes the Trappers’ Guild, spinning Riley down a more dangerous path than she ever could have imagined. As her whole world crashes down around her, who can Riley trust with her heart—and her life?</description>

  <description>When Hector Lewis told his daughter that she had a nothing face, it was just another bit of tossed-off cruelty from a man who specialized in harsh words and harsher deeds. But twenty years later, Heloise considers it a blessing to be a person who knows how to avoid attention. In the comfortable suburb where she lives, she's just a mom, the youngish widow with a forgettable job who somehow never misses a soccer game or a school play. In the state capitol, she's the redheaded lobbyist with a good cause and a mediocre track record.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in discreet hotel rooms throughout the area, she's the woman of your dreams—if you can afford her hourly fee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more than a decade, Heloise has believed she is safe. She has created a rigidly compartmentalized life, maintaining no real friendships, trusting few confidantes. Only now her secret life, a life she was forced to build after the legitimate world turned its back on her, is under siege. Her once oblivious accountant is asking loaded questions. Her longtime protector is hinting at new, mysterious dangers. Her employees can't be trusted. One county over, another so-called suburban madam has been found dead in her car, a suicide. Or is it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing is as it seems as Heloise faces a midlife crisis with much higher stakes than most will ever know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then she learns that her son's father might be released from prison, which is problematic because he doesn't know he has a son. The killer and former pimp also doesn't realize that he's serving a life sentence because Heloise betrayed him. But he's clearly beginning to suspect that Heloise has been holding something back all these years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With no formal education, no real family, and no friends, Heloise has to remake her life—again. Disappearing will be the easy part. She's done it before and she can do it again. A new name and a new place aren't hard to come by if you know the right people. The trick will be living long enough to start a new life.</description>

  <description>When two unlikely allies become two unwitting outlaws, will two unforgettable lovers defy unbeatable odds?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Bonnie Rae Shelby is a superstar. She’s rich. She’s beautiful. She’s impossibly famous. And Bonnie Rae Shelby wants to die. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Finn Clyde is a nobody. He’s broken. He’s brilliant. He’s impossibly cynical. And all he wants is a chance at life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  One girl. One boy. An act of compassion. A bizarre set of circumstances. And a choice – turn your head and walk away, or reach out your hand and risk it all? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  With that choice, the clock starts ticking on a man with a past and a girl who can’t face the future, counting down the seconds in an adventure riddled with heartbreak and humor, misunderstanding and revelation. With the world against them, two very different people take a journey that will not only change their lives, but may cost them their lives as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Infinity + One is a tale of shooting stars and fame and fortune, of gilded cages and iron bars, of finding a friend behind a stranger’s face, and discovering love in the oddest of places. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infinity + One – coming June, 2014&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>If high school is all about social status, Indigo Blackwood has it made. Sure, her quirky mom owns an occult shop, and a nerd just won’t stop trying to be her friend, but Indie is a popular cheerleader with a football-star boyfriend and a social circle powerful enough to ruin everyone at school. Who wouldn’t want to be her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a guy dies right before her eyes. And the dusty old family Bible her mom is freakishly possessive of is stolen. But it’s when a frustratingly sexy stranger named Bishop enters Indie’s world that she learns her destiny involves a lot more than pom-poms and parties. If she doesn’t get the Bible back, every witch on the planet will die. And that’s seriously bad news for Indie, because according to Bishop, she’s a witch too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly forced into a centuries-old war between witches and sorcerers, Indie’s about to uncover the many dark truths about her life—and a future unlike any she ever imagined on top of the cheer pyramid.</description>

For fans of Moira Young’s Dust Lands series, La Femme Nikita, and the movie Hanna.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meadow Woodson, a fifteen-year-old girl who has been trained by her father to fight, to kill, and to survive in any situation, lives with her family on a houseboat in Florida. The state is controlled by The Murder Complex, an organization that tracks the population with precision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The plot starts to thicken when Meadow meets Zephyr James, who is—although he doesn’t know it—one of the MC’s programmed assassins. Is their meeting a coincidence? Destiny? Or part of a terrifying strategy? And will Zephyr keep Meadow from discovering the haunting truth about her family?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Action-packed, blood-soaked, and chilling, this is a dark and compelling debut novel by Lindsay Cummings.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Why be the sheep, when you can be the wolf?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ismae escapes from the brutality of an arranged marriage into the sanctuary of the convent of St. Mortain, where the sisters still serve the gods of old. Here she learns that the god of Death Himself has blessed her with dangerous gifts—and a violent destiny. If she chooses to stay at the convent, she will be trained as an assassin and serve as a handmaiden to Death. To claim her new life, she must destroy the lives of others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ismae’s most important assignment takes her straight into the high court of Brittany—where she finds herself woefully under prepared—not only for the deadly games of intrigue and treason, but for the impossible choices she must make. For how can she deliver Death’s vengeance upon a target who, against her will, has stolen her heart?</description>

  <description>Wyldcliffe Abbey School for Young Ladies, housed in a Gothic mansion on the bleak northern moors, is elite, expensive, and unwelcoming. When Evie Johnson is torn away from her home by the sea to become the newest scholarship student, she is more isolated than she could have dreamed. Strict teachers, snobbish students, and the oppressive atmosphere of Wyldcliffe leave Evie drowning in loneliness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evie’s only lifeline is Sebastian, a rebellious, mocking, dangerously attractive young man she meets by chance. As Evie’s feelings for Sebastian grow with each secret meeting, she starts to fear that he is hiding something about his past. And she is haunted by glimpses of a strange, ghostly girl—a girl who is so eerily like Evie, she could be a sister. Evie is slowly drawn into a tangled web of past and present that she cannot control. And as the extraordinary, elemental forces of Wyldcliffe rise up like the mighty sea, Evie is faced with an astounding truth about Sebastian, and her own incredible fate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gillian Shields’s electrifying tale will dazzle readers with suspense, mysticism, and romance.</description>

But when Ben, the mysterious new guy, starts junior year at her high school, Camelia's life becomes anything but ordinary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rumored to be somehow responsible for his ex-girlfriend's accidental death, Ben is immediately ostracized by everyone on campus. Except for Camelia. She's reluctant to believe the rumors, even when her friends try to convince her otherwise. She's inexplicably drawn to Ben and to his touch. But soon, Camelia is receiving eerie phone calls and strange packages with threatening notes. Ben insists she is in danger, and that he can help-but can he be trusted? She knows he's hiding something... but he's not the only one with a secret.&lt;br&gt;From the best-selling author of Blue is for Nightmares comes a story of paranormal romance that's sure to be a thrilling and chilling teen favorite.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;Alexis thought she led a typically dysfunctional high school existence. Dysfunctional like her parents' marriage; her doll-crazy twelve-year-old sister, Kasey; and even her own anti-social, anti-cheerleader attitude. When a family fight results in some tearful sisterly bonding, Alexis realizes that her life is creeping from dysfunction into danger. Kasey is acting stranger than ever: her blue eyes go green sometimes; she uses old-fashioned language; and she even loses track of chunks of time, claiming to know nothing about her strange behavior. Their old house is changing, too. Doors open and close by themselves; water boils on the unlit stove; and an unplugged air conditioner turns the house cold enough to see their breath in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexis wants to think that it's all in her head, but soon, what she liked to think of as silly parlor tricks are becoming life-threatening--to her, her family, and to her budding relationship with the class president. Alexis knows she's the only person who can stop Kasey -- but what if that green-eyed girl isn't even Kasey anymore?</description>

  <description>Stolen as a child from her large and loving family, and on the run with her mom for more than ten years, Callie has only the barest idea of what normal life might be like. She's never had a home, never gone to school, and has gotten most of her meals from laundromat vending machines. Her dreams are haunted by memories she’d like to forget completely. But when Callie’s mom is finally arrested for kidnapping her, and Callie’s real dad whisks her back to what would have been her life, in a small town in Florida, Callie must find a way to leave the past behind. She must learn to be part of a family. And she must believe that love--even with someone who seems an improbable choice--is more than just a possibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trish Doller writes incredibly real teens, and this searing story of love, betrayal, and how not to lose your mind will resonate with readers who want their stories gritty and utterly true.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;If you want to survive, you have to follow the rules…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mikayla Morgan is wanted for her mother's murder. She's been on the run for almost a year now, avoiding not only the police but the real killer. Tired of running and desperate to clear her name, she breaks one of the most sacred rules: never return to the scene of the crime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every bounty hunter on the Eastern Seaboard is after the Morgan girl—but Shaun Denver and his partner snagged her. She's a piece of work, and Shaun can't decide if he wants to kiss her or kill her. When things take a sharp turn south, Shaun does the only thing he can think of to keep her close—he handcuffs them together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the danger mounts and the killer closes in, the chemistry between them threatens to explode. Shaun and Kayla will need to break all the rules if they hope to get out of this alive.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Parker Frost has never taken the road less traveled. Valedictorian and quintessential good girl, she’s about to graduate high school without ever having kissed her crush or broken the rules. So when fate drops a clue in her lap—one that might be the key to unraveling a town mystery—she decides to take a chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julianna Farnetti and Shane Cruz are remembered as the golden couple of Summit Lakes High—perfect in every way, meant to be together forever. But Julianna’s journal tells a different story—one of doubts about Shane and a forbidden romance with an older, artistic guy. These are the secrets that were swept away with her the night that Shane’s jeep plunged into an icy river, leaving behind a grieving town and no bodies to bury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading Julianna’s journal gives Parker the courage to start to really live—and it also gives her reasons to question what really happened the night of the accident. Armed with clues from the past, Parker enlists the help of her best friend, Kat, and Trevor, her longtime crush, to track down some leads. The mystery ends up taking Parker places that she never could have imagined. And she soon finds that taking the road less traveled makes all the difference.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;What if your devastating break-up became this summer’s hit single? In this rock-and-roll retelling of Jane Austen’s Persuasion, music can either bring you together or tear you apart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At her dying mother’s request, Claire dumps Jared, the only boy she’s ever loved. Left with a broken family and a broken heart, Claire is furious when she discovers that her biggest regret became Jared’s big break. While Jared is catapulted into rock-star status, another piece of Claire’s heart crumbles every time his song plays on the radio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The summer after her senior year, it’s been months since the big break-up, and Claire is just trying to keep her head down and make it through a tense trip to the beach with her family. But when Jared shows up, and old feelings reignite, can Claire and Jared let go of the past? Or will they be stuck singing the same old refrain?</description>

  <description>Making friends has never been Elise Dembowski’s strong suit. All throughout her life, she’s been the butt of every joke and the outsider in every conversation. When a final attempt at popularity fails, Elise nearly gives up. Then she stumbles upon a warehouse party where she meets Vicky, a girl in a band who accepts her; Char, a cute, yet mysterious disc jockey; Pippa, a carefree spirit from England; and most importantly, a love for DJing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told in a refreshingly genuine and laugh-out-loud funny voice, &lt;em&gt;This Song Will Save Your Life&lt;/em&gt; is an exuberant novel about identity, friendship, and the power of music to bring people together.</description>

  <description>Golden boy Ezra Faulkner believes everyone has a tragedy waiting for them—a single encounter after which everything that really matters will happen. His particular tragedy waited until he was primed to lose it all: in one spectacular night, a reckless driver shatters Ezra’s knee, his athletic career, and his social life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No longer a front-runner for Homecoming King, Ezra finds himself at the table of misfits, where he encounters new girl Cassidy Thorpe. Cassidy is unlike anyone Ezra’s ever met, achingly effortless, fiercely intelligent, and determined to bring Ezra along on her endless adventures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Ezra dives into his new studies, new friendships, and new love, he learns that some people, like books, are easy to misread. And now he must consider: if one’s singular tragedy has already hit and everything after it has mattered quite a bit, what happens when more misfortune strikes? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robyn Schneider’s &lt;em&gt;The Beginning of Everything&lt;/em&gt; is a lyrical, witty, and heart-wrenching novel about how difficult it is to play the part that people expect, and how new beginnings can stem from abrupt and tragic endings.</description>

  <description>Low-life writer and unrepentant alcoholic Henry Chinaski was born to survive. After decades of slacking off at low-paying dead-end jobs, blowing his cash on booze and women, and scrimping by in flea-bitten apartments, Chinaski sees his poetic star rising at last. Now, at fifty, he is reveling in his sudden rock-star life, running three hundred hangovers a year, and maintaining a sex life that would cripple Casanova.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With all of Bukowski's trademark humor and gritty, dark honesty, this 1978 follow-up to &lt;em&gt;Post Office&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Factotum&lt;/em&gt; is an uncompromising account of life on the edge.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life&lt;/em&gt; is our finest, most important creation to date. It’s also the best thing we’ve ever written about Minimalism and will likely serve as the cornerstone to our work for years to come. It took us a year to write this book—a year of creating the best material possible and finding ways to relate it back to our lives so you would have practical ways to relate the subject matter to your life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter Themes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you jump out of bed every morning excited about the day in front of you? Do you live a life defined by deep meaning, endless passion, excellent health, empowering relationships, and constant growth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultimately, the eight chapters and ninety-eight sections inside this book are meant to help you take small actions each day that will radically improve your life over a short period of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book’s foreword and first chapter go into vast detail on our personal backgrounds, our troubled pasts, our depression, and how we made changes that transformed our lives over two years. These chapters discuss why didn’t feel fulfilled by our careers and why we turned to our society’s idea of a meaningful life: we bought stuff, we spent too much money, and we lived paycheck to paycheck trying to purchase happiness in every trip to the shopping mall or luxurious vacation we could find. Instead of finding our passion, instead of searching for our mission, we pacified ourselves with ephemeral indulgences, inducing a crack-cocaine high that didn’t last far past the checkout line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The subsequent chapters move on the the five dimensions that comprise a meaningful life:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Health&lt;br&gt;2. Relationships&lt;br&gt;3. Passions&lt;br&gt;4. Growth&lt;br&gt;5. Contribution&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are the things we changed in our lives that had the most impact. These changes resulted in more meaningful lives for the two of us. These five chapters discuss each of these concepts in depth, much more than our website. Throughout these chapters we consider why these areas are the most important dimensions of our lives and how minimalism allowed us to focus on these areas. We give you personal examples of how we changed everything in our lives over two year span. We left our big corporate jobs, changed our diets, started exercising regularly, got healthy, strengthened our core relationships, made great new relationships, started pursuing our passions, contributed to more people than we ever had, and found ways to be happy and content with our lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The final chapter of this book, "The Confluence of Meaning," binds together the five dimensions and asks the reader important questions about their life. These questions are not rhetorical, they are meant to make you think. The entire book is designed to help you actively engage in each chapter by reading the content more than once, taking notes, highlighting meaningful passages, making lists, and, most importantly, taking action.</description>

  <description>William Golding's compelling story about a group of very ordinary small boys marooned on a coral island has become a modern classic. At first, it seems as though it's all going to be great fun; but the fun before long becomes furious &amp;amp; life on the island turns into a nightmare of panic &amp;amp; death. As ordinary standards of behavior collapse, the whole world the boys know collapses with them—the world of cricket &amp;amp; homework &amp;amp; adventure stories—&amp;amp; another world is revealed beneath, primitive &amp;amp; terrible. &lt;strong&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/strong&gt; remains as provocative today as when it was 1st published in 1954, igniting passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. Though critically acclaimed, it was largely ignored upon its initial publication. Yet soon it became a cult favorite among both students and literary critics who compared it to J.D. Salinger's &lt;strong&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/strong&gt; in its influence on modern thought &amp;amp; literature. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, &lt;strong&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/strong&gt; has established itself as a classic.</description>

  <description>Clive Barker is widely acknowledged as the master of nerve-shattering horror.  The Hellbound Heart is one of his best, one of the most dead-frightening stories you are likely to ever read, a story of the human heart and all the great terrors and ecstasies within.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At last he had solved the puzzle of Lemarchand's box. He was standing on the threshold of a world of heightened sensations. In moments the Cenobites - who had dedicated an eternity to the pursuit of sensuality - would be here. They would reveal dark secrets that would transform him forever.</description>

  <description>Un diagnostic fatal o determină să o ia la fugă şi să se ascundă. Fără nicio explicaţie. Îşi abandonează iubitul, părinţii, prietenii... tot. Pleacă din ţară ca să-şi trăiască sfârşitul într-o singurătate deplină, scriind mail-uri pe care nu le trimite niciodată. &lt;br&gt;După doi ani, îşi reface analizele. Verdictul medical are efect de dinamită. Anulează toate aşteptările. E sănătoasă tun, fără urmă de neoplasm, prin urmare, în viaţă. După doi ani în care a dansat tango cu moartea, revine în povestea din care evadase, dar nu se mai identifică profund cu nimic. Acvariul cu lumea ei de demult, cu peşti-emoţii, cu scoici-amintiri, cu gânduri-nisipuri, cu plante-vise, mediul ei vital de mai înainte, se dovedeşte a fi acum ceva banal, deloc esenţial, foarte simplu de înlocuit. Singurul lucru cu care rămâne după această jupuire e sinele. &lt;br&gt;Dacă primul diagnostic a fost greşit sau dacă şi-a inventat povestea doar ca să fugă de realitatea în care era... nu mai contează atâta timp cât, însoţind-o pas cu pas pe drumul ei, ne-am făcut ţăndări ca să ne recompunem, am minţit ca să descoperim adevărul, am urât ca să aflăm iubirea adevărată, ne-am pierdut definitiv ca să îl regăsim pe Dumnezeu pentru totdeauna.</description>

  <description>Cas Lowood has inherited an unusual vocation: He kills the dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So did his father before him, until he was gruesomely murdered by a ghost he sought to kill. Now, armed with his father's mysterious and deadly athame, Cas travels the country with his kitchen-witch mother and their spirit-sniffing cat. They follow legends and local lore, destroy the murderous dead, and keep pesky things like the future and friends at bay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Searching for a ghost the locals call Anna Dressed in Blood, Cas expects the usual: track, hunt, kill. What he finds instead is a girl entangled in curses and rage, a ghost like he's never faced before. She still wears the dress she wore on the day of her brutal murder in 1958: once white, now stained red and dripping with blood. Since her death, Anna has killed any and every person who has dared to step into the deserted Victorian she used to call home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet she spares Cas's life.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;This whole grim reaper thing should have come with a manual.&lt;br&gt;Or a diagram of some kind.&lt;br&gt;A flow chart would have been nice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charley Davidson is a part-time private investigator and full-time grim reaper. Meaning, she sees dead people. Really. And it's her job to convince them to "go into the light." But when these very dead people have died under less than ideal circumstances (like murder), sometimes they want Charley to bring the bad guys to justice. Complicating matters are the intensely hot dreams she's been having about an entity who has been following her all her life...and it turns out he might not be dead after all. In fact, he might be something else entirely. But what does he want with Charley? And why can't she seem to resist him? And what does she have to lose by giving in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With scorching-hot tension and high-octane humor, &lt;em&gt;First Grave on the Right&lt;/em&gt; is your signpost to paranormal suspense of the highest order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;em&gt;But This is What Happens When You Fall for the Angel of Death.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until the day the school's designated loner, Cameron Lusk, begins to stalk her, turning up where she least expects it, standing outside her house in the dark, tough, sexy Jared Kovach - comes to school.

  &lt;em&gt;Life as She Knows it is About to Change Forever.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does Jared know about her parents? Why does Cameron tell Jared he can't have Lorelei? And what will any of them do when Death comes knocking for real? Thrilling, sassy, sexy, and inventive, &lt;em&gt;Death and the Girl Next Door&lt;/em&gt; proves Darynda Jones is a force to be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Midnight Sun&lt;/em&gt; is the much anticipated retelling of &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; from Edward Cullen's perspective. An unedited partial draft was illegally leaked onto the internet in 2008; consequently, author Stephenie Meyer put the project on indefinite hold. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortly afterward, she posted a letter to her fans on her website including a link to the entire partial draft of the book so that those who wanted to read it could do so legally and with her consent; see URL for more information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;  Do not add a cover.  Do not add translations.  Do not add any other editions.</description>

  <description>Sadie White's summer job isn't going to be on the beach life-guarding or working at rental booths like most kids her age. With her single mother's increasing pregnancy and refusal to work, Sadie has to take over her mother's job as a domestic servant for one of the wealthy summer families on a nearby island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the family arrives at their summer getaway, Sadie is surprised to learn that the owner of the house is Jax Stone, one of the hottest teen rockers in the world. If Sadie hadn't spent her life raising her mother and taking care of the house she might have been normal enough to be excited about working for a rock star.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though Sadie isn't impressed by Jax's fame, he is drawn to her. Everything about Sadie fascinates Jax but he fights his attraction. Relationships never work in his world and as badly as he wants Sadie, he believes she deserves more. By the end of the summer, Jax discovers he can't breathe without Sadie.</description>

  <description>What happens when you fall in love with the perfect guy... twice... in one day?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brenna Blixen spent her freshman year homeschooling in Denmark; now that she’s back in the States, she’s determined to make her sophomore year unforgettable. And by unforgettable, she imagined awesome classes, fun friendships, and maybe a little romance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What she got was a whole lot of romance, and all at once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The same day that dark, brooding Saxon Maclean charmed her with his killer good looks and whip-smart wit, Jake Kelly stole her breath away with his heart-wrenching smile and intelligent, thoughtful focus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Saxon is a proud player who makes it clear that he doesn’t know why he can’t get Brenna off of his mind and out of his system, and Jake’s sweet and humble attitude hides a secret past life that might be more darker and more complex than Brenna’s willing to handle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complicating the matter is the fact that Saxon and Jake were once best friends and are now arch-enemies... and the more Brenna finds out about their connection to each other, the more intrigued and worried she becomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between keeping the peace with her lovingly over-protective parents, designing t-shirts for her high school’s rising punk band, keeping up her grades in both academic and technical high school, and running the track like a maniac, Brenna has enough to worry about with out juggling two guys who make her heart thud and drive her crazy all at once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has to make a choice. But how can she when giving her heart to one of them might mean breaking the other’s?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Cover Design: Steven Peterson)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recommended Age: Older YA</description>

  <description>17-year-old Lila has two secrets she’s prepared to take to the grave. The first is that she can move things just by looking at them. The second is that she’s been in love with her brother’s best friend, Alex, since forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a mugging exposes her unique ability, Lila decides to run to the only people she can trust—her brother and Alex. They live in Southern California where they work for a secret organization called The Unit, and Lila discovers that the two of them are hunting down the men who murdered her mother five years before. And that they’ve found them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a world where nothing and no one is quite as they seem, Lila quickly realizes that she is not alone—there are others out there just like her—people with special powers—and her mother’s killer is one of them…</description>

  <description>Ellen O'Farrell is an expert when it comes to human frailties. She's a hypnotherapist who helps her clients deal with everything from addictions to life-long phobias. So when she falls in love with a man who is being stalked by his ex-girlfriend she's more intrigued than frightened. What makes a supposedly smart, professional woman behave this way? She'd love to meet her!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What she doesn't know is that she already has. Saskia has been masquerading as a client, and their lives are set to collide in ways Ellen could never have predicted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This wonderfully perceptive new novel from Liane Moriarty is about the lines we'll cross for love. It's about the murky areas between right and wrong, and the complexities of modern relationships.</description>

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Damaged Portland detective Archie Sheridan spent ten years tracking Gretchen Lowell, a beautiful serial killer, but in the end she was the one who caught him. Two years ago, Gretchen kidnapped Archie and tortured him for ten days, but instead of killing him, she mysteriously decided to let him go. She turned herself in, and now Gretchen has been locked away for the rest of her life, while Archie is in a prison of another kind---addicted to pain pills, unable to return to his old life, powerless to get those ten horrific days off his mind. Archie's a different person, his estranged wife says, and he knows she's right. He continues to visit Gretchen in prison once a week, saying that only he can get her to confess as to the whereabouts of more of her victims, but even he knows the truth---he can't stay away.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;When another killer begins snatching teenage girls off the streets of Portland, Archie has to pull himself together enough to lead the new task force investigating the murders. A hungry young newspaper reporter, Susan Ward, begins profiling Archie and the investigation, which sparks a deadly game between Archie, Susan, the new killer, and even Gretchen. They need to catch a killer, and maybe somehow then Archie can free himself from Gretchen, once and for all. Either way, &lt;em&gt;Heartsick&lt;/em&gt; makes for one of the most extraordinary suspense debuts in recent memory.&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>The year is 1954. U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new -partner, Chuck Aule, have come to Shutter Island, home of Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane, to investigate the disappearance of a patient. Multiple-murderess Rachel Solando is loose somewhere on this barren island, despite having been kept in a locked cell under constant surveillance. As a killer hurricane bears relentlessly down on them, a strange case takes on even darker, more sinister shades--with hints of radical experimentation, horrifying surgeries, and lethal countermoves made in the cause of a covert shadow war. No one is going to escape Shutter Island unscathed, because nothing at Ashecliffe Hospital is remotely what it seems</description>

  <description>One night after interviewing a reluctant witness at a London apartment complex, Lacey Flint, a young detective constable, stumbles onto a woman brutally stabbed just moments before in the building’s darkened parking lot. Within twenty-four hours a reporter receives an anonymous letter that points out alarming similarities between the murder and Jack the Ripper’s first murder—a letter that calls out Lacey by name. If it’s real, and they have a killer bent on re-creating London’s bloody past, history shows they have just five days until the next attempt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one believes the connections are anything more than a sadistic killer’s game, not even Lacey, whom the killer seems to be taunting specifically. However, as they investigate the details of the case start reminding her more and more of a part of her past she’d rather keep hidden. And the only way to do that is to catch the killer herself.</description>

  <description>That Boy is a contemporary romance about falling in love with the boys next door.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know, being friends with two cute boys does have its benefits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's Danny. Danny is a golden boy in every way. He has dreamy blue eyes and blonde hair that always looks perfect, even when it’s windblown or been stuck under a football helmet. He’s the boy every girl crushes on. The boy I get into trouble with, the boy I fight with, the hot quarterback no girl can resist, not even me. Being with Danny is like being on an adventure. He has a bright, contagious smile and abs to die for. He’s pretty much irresistible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Equally crush worthy is Phillip. Adorable, sweet Phillip, who I have known since birth.  Phillip has dark hair, a perfect smile, brown eyes, and the sexiest voice I have ever heard. He’s the boy I talk to every night before I go to sleep. The boy who rescues me, the boy who can read my mind, the boy who is always there for me, the boy who tries to keep me out of trouble, the boy who irritatingly keeps getting hotter, and whose strong arms always seem to find their way around me.  And when he gives me that grin, I can never say no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One boy will give me my very first kiss.&lt;br&gt;One boy will teach me to make out.&lt;br&gt;One boy will take me to prom.&lt;br&gt;And finally, one boy will ask me to marry him.&lt;br&gt;They will both be my best friends.&lt;br&gt;But only one of them will be the boy I fall in love with.&lt;br&gt;Only one of them is That Boy.</description>

  <description>Approach page design in a revolutionary new way! Unlike other graphic design books,&lt;strong&gt; The Elements of Graphic Design&lt;/strong&gt;reveals the secrets of successful graphic design from the unique perspective of the page’s “white space.” With the help of carefully selected examples from art, design, and architecture, the book illuminates the role of each design element and how it can be rendered more effective by including white space in the page architecture. The book also demonstrates how white space can lend “sound” to typography or shift the “weight” of a page. Clear, insightful comments are presented in a dynamic page design, and interactive design elements, thought-provoking captions, and scores of illustrations challenge designers to “think out of the box.”.</description>

  <description>THE BRAND GAP is the first book to present a unified theory of brand-building. Whereas most books on branding are weighted toward either a strategic or creative approach, this book shows how both ways of thinking can unite to produce a "charismatic brand"-a brand that customers feel is essential to their lives. In an entertaining two-hour read you'll learn: the new definition of brand the five essential disciplines of brand-building how branding is changing the dynamics of competition the three most powerful questions to ask about any brand why collaboration is the key to brand-building how design determines a customer's experience how to test brand concepts quickly and cheaply the importance of managing brands from the inside 220-word brand glossary</description>

  <description>The organization of letters on a blank sheet—or screen—is the most basic challenge facing anyone who practices design. What type of font to use? How big? How should those letters, words, and paragraphs be aligned, spaced, ordered, shaped, and otherwise manipulated? In this groundbreaking new primer, leading design educator and historian Ellen Lupton provides clear and concise guidance for anyone learning or brushing up on their typographic skills. &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinking with Type&lt;/em&gt; is divided into three sections: letter, text, and grid. Each section begins with an easy-to-grasp essay that reviews historical, technological, and theoretical concepts, and is then followed by a set of practical exercises that bring the material covered to life. Sections conclude with examples of work by leading practitioners that demonstrate creative possibilities (along with some classic no-no's to avoid).</description>

  <description>There are a lot of books out there that show collections of logos. But David Airey’s “Logo Design Love” is something different: it’s a guide for designers (and clients) who want to understand what this mysterious business is all about. Written in reader-friendly, concise language, with a minimum of designer jargon, Airey gives a surprisingly clear explanation of the process, using a wide assortment of real-life examples to support his points. Anyone involved in creating visual identities, or wanting to learn how to go about it, will find this book invaluable. - Tom Geismar, Chermayeff &amp;amp; Geismar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Logo Design Love&lt;/em&gt;, Irish graphic designer David Airey brings the best parts of his wildly popular blog of the same name to the printed page. Just as in the blog, David fills each page of this simple, modern-looking book with gorgeous logos and real world anecdotes that illustrate best practices for designing brand identity systems that last.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;David not only shares his experiences working with clients, including sketches and final results of his successful designs, but uses the work of many well-known designers to explain why well-crafted brand identity systems are important, how to create iconic logos, and how to best work with clients to achieve success as a designer. Contributors include Gerard Huerta, who designed the logos for &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine and Waldenbooks; Lindon Leader, who created the current FedEx brand identity system as well as the CIGNA logo; and many more.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Readers will learn:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Why one logo is more effective than another&lt;br&gt;• How to create their own iconic designs&lt;br&gt;• What sets some designers above the rest&lt;br&gt;• Best practices for working with clients&lt;br&gt;• 25 practical design tips for creating logos that last</description>

  <description>Whether a marketing campaign or a museum exhibit, a video game or a complex control system, the design we see is the culmination of many concepts and practices brought together from a variety of disciplines. Because no one can be an expert on everything, designers have always had to scramble to find the information and know-how required to make a design workùuntil now.&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Universal Principles of Design&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; is the first cross-disciplinary reference of design. Richly illustrated and easy to navigate, this book pairs clear explanations of the design concepts featured with visual examples of those concepts applied in practice. From the 80/20 rule to chunking, from baby-face bias to Ockham's razor, and from self-similarity to storytelling, 100 design concepts are defined and illustrated for readers to expand their knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This landmark reference will become the standard for designers, engineers, architects, and students who seek to broaden and improve their design expertise.</description>

  <description>A breathtaking journey toward self-discovery and true love, from the author of &lt;em&gt;If I Stay&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When sheltered American good girl Allyson "LuLu" Healey first meets laid-back Dutch actor Willem De Ruiter at an underground performance of &lt;em&gt;Twelfth Night &lt;/em&gt;in England, there’s an undeniable spark. After just one day together, that spark bursts into a flame, or so it seems to Allyson, until the following morning, when she wakes up after a whirlwind day in Paris to discover that Willem has left. Over the next year, Allyson embarks on a journey to come to terms with the narrow confines of her life, and through Shakespeare, travel, and a quest for her almost-true-love, to break free of those confines.</description>

  <description>I wasn't always in love with Colton Calloway; I was in love with his younger brother, Kyle, first. Kyle was my first one true love, my first in every way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, one stormy August night, he died, and the person I was died with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colton didn't teach me how to live. He didn't heal the pain. He didn't make it okay. He taught me how to hurt, how to not be okay, and, eventually, how to let go.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this madcap journey, a bestselling journalist investigates psychopaths and the industry of doctors, scientists, and everyone else who studies them. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Psychopath Test&lt;/em&gt; is a fascinating journey through the minds of madness. Jon Ronson's exploration of a potential hoax being played on the world's top neurologists takes him, unexpectedly, into the heart of the madness industry. An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are, in fact, psychopaths teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson, armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities, enters the corridors of power. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud in Coxsackie, New York; a legendary CEO whose psychopathy has been speculated about in the press; and a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane who insists he's sane and certainly not a psychopath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Ronson not only solves the mystery of the hoax but also discovers, disturbingly, that sometimes the personalities at the helm of the madness industry are, with their drives and obsessions, as mad in their own way as those they study. And that relatively ordinary people are, more and more, defined by their maddest edges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Watch a Video</description>

  <description>Say you want to start going to the gym or practicing a musical instrument. How long should it take before you stop having to force it and start doing it automatically?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The surprising answers are found in &lt;em&gt;Making Habits, Breaking Habits&lt;/em&gt;, a psychologist’s popular examination of one of the most powerful and under-appreciated processes in the mind. Although people like to think that they are in control, much of human behavior occurs without any decision-making or conscious thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing on hundreds of fascinating studies, psychologist Jeremy Dean busts the myths to finally explain why seemingly easy habits, like eating an apple a day, can be surprisingly difficult to form, and how to take charge of your brain’s natural “autopilot” to make any change stick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Witty and intriguing, &lt;em&gt;Making Habits, Breaking Habits&lt;/em&gt; shows how behavior is more than just a product of what you think. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to bend your habits to your will—and be happier, more creative, and more productive.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>I am not a slut, although I’ve been called one often enough. Yeah, I spent three months screwing one of my college professors, but I was crazy about the guy. Then he broke up with me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not a bitch, although people like to say I am. I kept our relationship secret. I’m not responsible for telling the university administrators about it, but a lot of students still blame me for getting their favorite professor fired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not a drama queen, although everyone thinks I am now. When I got a few nasty messages, I just deleted them. When I got the threat, I assumed it was someone being stupid. I still think that’s all it was. My parents worry, though, so they hired me a bodyguard. Now Jack follows me around, intimidating everyone who approaches me and looking obnoxiously hot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is what I am. I’m Chloe. I’m a twenty-year-old art history major. Kind of shy, although I pretend not to be. Stubborn enough to stay here for my senior year, even though everyone hates me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I’m stuck with Jack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He calls me “Princess,” but I’m not a princess either.</description>

  <description>"A tingle arced across my scalp. The floor tipped up at me and my body spiraled away. Then I was on the ceiling looking down, waiting to see what would happen next." Callie cuts herself. Never too deep, never enough to die. But enough to feel the pain. Enough to feel the scream inside. Now she's at Sea Pines, a "residential treatment facility" filled with girls struggling with problems of their own. Callie doesn't want to have anything to do with them. She doesn't want to have anything to do with anyone. She won't even speak. But Callie can only stay silent for so long...</description>

  <description>In today's world, yesterday's methods just don't work. In Getting Things Done, veteran coach and management consultant David Allen shares the breakthrough methods for stress-free performance that he has introduced to tens of thousands of people across the country. Allen's premise is simple: our productivity is directly proportional to our ability to relax. Only when our minds are clear and our thoughts are organized can we achieve effective productivity and unleash our creative potential. In Getting Things Done Allen shows how to:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Apply the "do it, delegate it, defer it, drop it" rule to get your in-box to empty&lt;br&gt;* Reassess goals and stay focused in changing situations&lt;br&gt;* Plan projects as well as get them unstuck&lt;br&gt;* Overcome feelings of confusion, anxiety, and being overwhelmed&lt;br&gt;* Feel fine about what you're not doing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From core principles to proven tricks, Getting Things Done can transform the way you work, showing you how to pick up the pace without wearing yourself down.</description>

  <description>Scott Adams has likely failed at more things than anyone you’ve ever met or anyone you’ve even heard of. So how did he go from hapless office worker and serial failure to the creator of &lt;em&gt;Dilbert&lt;/em&gt;, one of the world’s most famous syndicated comic strips, in just a few years? In &lt;em&gt;How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big&lt;/em&gt;, Adams shares the strategy he has used since he was a teen to invite failure in, to embrace it, then pick its pocket. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No career guide can offer advice for success that works for everyone. As Adams explains, your best bet is to study the ways of others who made it big and try to glean some tricks and strategies that make sense for you. Adams pulls back the covers on his own unusual life and shares what he learned for turning one failure after another into something good and lasting. Adams reveals that he failed at just about everything he’s tried, including his corporate career, his inventions, his investments, and his two restaurants. But there’s a lot to learn from his personal story, and a lot of humor along the way. While it’s hard for anyone to recover from a personal or professional failure, Adams discovered some unlikely truths that helped to propel him forward. For instance:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Goals are for losers. Systems are for winners.&lt;br&gt;• "Passion" is bull. What you need is personal energy.&lt;br&gt;• A combination of mediocre skills can make you surprisingly valuable.&lt;br&gt;• You can manage your odds in a way that makes you look lucky to others.</description>

  <description>The dancing girls of Lahore inhabit the Diamond Market in the shadow of a great mosque. The twenty-first century goes on outside the walls of this ancient quarter but scarcely registers within. Though their trade can be described with accuracy as prostitution, the dancing girls have an illustrious history: Beloved by emperors and nawabs, their sophisticated art encompassed the best of Mughal culture. The modern-day Bollywood aesthetic, with its love of gaudy spectacle, music, and dance, is their distant legacy. But the life of the pampered courtesan is not the one now being lived by Maha and her three girls. What they do is forbidden by Islam, though tolerated; but they are gandi, "unclean," and Maha's daughters, like her, are born into the business and will not leave it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sociologist Louise Brown spent four years in the most intimate study of the family life of a Lahori dancing girl. With beautiful understatement, she turns a novelist's eye on a true story that beggars the imagination. Maha, a classically trained dancer of exquisite grace, had her virginity sold to a powerful Arab sheikh at the age of twelve; when her own daughter Nena comes of age and Maha cannot bring in the money she once did, she faces a terrible decision as the agents of the sheikh come calling once more.</description>

  <description>What was once the western United States is now home to the Republic, a nation perpetually at war with its neighbors. Born into an elite family in one of the Republic's wealthiest districts, fifteen-year-old June is a prodigy being groomed for success in the Republic's highest military circles. Born into the slums, fifteen-year-old Day is the country's most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross paths - until the day June's brother, Metias, is murdered and Day becomes the prime suspect. Caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race for his family's survival, while June seeks to avenge Metias's death. But in a shocking turn of events, the two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together, and the sinister lengths their country will go to keep its secrets.</description>

  <description>The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon out of his life as a San Francisco web-design drone, and serendipity, sheer curiosity and the ability to climb a ladder like a monkey have landed him a new gig working the night shift at Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore. But after just a few days on the job, Clay begins to realize that this store is even more curious than the name suggests. There are only a few customers, but they come in repeatedly and never seem to actually buy anything, instead “checking out” impossibly obscure volumes from strange corners of the store, all according to some elaborate, long-standing arrangement with gnomic Mr. Penumbra. The store must be a front for something larger, Clay concludes, and soon he has embarked on a complex analysis of the customers’ behaviour and roped his friends into helping him figure out just what’s going on. But once they bring their findings to Mr. Penumbra, they discover the secrets extend far beyond the walls of the bookstore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With irresistible brio and dazzling intelligence, Robin Sloan has crafted a literary adventure story for the 21st century. Evoking both the fairy tale charm of Haruki Murakami and the enthusiastic novel-of-ideas wizardry of Neal Stephenson or a young Umberto Eco, but with a unique and feisty sensibility that’s rare to the world of literary fiction, Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore is exactly what it sounds like: an establishment you have to enter and will never want to leave, a modern-day cabinet of wonders ready to give a jolt of energy to every curious reader, no matter what the time of day.</description>

  <description>In nineteenth-century China, in a remote Hunan county, a girl named Lily, at the tender age of seven, is paired with a laotong, “old same,” in an emotional match that will last a lifetime. The laotong, Snow Flower, introduces herself by sending Lily a silk fan on which she’s painted a poem in nu shu, a unique language that Chinese women created in order to communicate in secret, away from the influence of men. As the years pass, Lily and Snow Flower send messages on fans, compose stories on handkerchiefs, reaching out of isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments. Together, they endure the agony of foot-binding, and reflect upon their arranged marriages, shared loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood. The two find solace, developing a bond that keeps their spirits alive. But when a misunderstanding arises, their deep friendship suddenly threatens to tear apart.</description>

  <description>"The moment she woke up, her nightmare began..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What would you do if you awakened to find a dangerous stranger in your house? In your bed, next to you? Now your home has become your prison, and your body, a battlefield. How would you hold onto your sanity, your self-esteem, your very soul against someone determined to annihilate all three?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the psychological thriller BREAK HER, one woman will find herself in this almost unthinkable situation, and one man will discover that he has finally come up against someone unlike any of those he has destroyed before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the surface, this intruder has all the advantages: strength, weapons, ruthlessness. The only way he can lose is if he finds himself responding to his victim on a human level. The only way she can win is if she rips away the protective lies she’s told herself, the hard shell of indifference she’s hidden in, and becomes again what she has not been since she lost everything that mattered to her, years ago: human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Includes graphic depictions of rape, sex, and violence and is for readers over the age of 18 only.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;From &lt;strong&gt;New York Times&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;USA Today&lt;/strong&gt; bestselling author &lt;strong&gt;Aleatha Romig&lt;/strong&gt; comes a suspenseful thriller about secrets and deception, passion and love, choices and consequences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every action has consequences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Waking in an unfamiliar bedroom in a luxurious mansion, Claire Nichols is terrified to discover that a chance encounter led her into the cruel hands of her abductor, Anthony Rawlings. Claire has no understanding of why she's there, but it's been made abundantly clear--she is now his acquisition and every action has consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn the rules to survive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facing incomprehensible circumstances, Claire must learn to survive her new reality--every aspect of her livelihood depends upon the tall, dark-eyed tycoon who is a true master of deception. Driven by unknown demons, he has no tolerance for imperfection, in any aspect of his life, including his recent acquisition. Anthony may appear to the world as a handsome, benevolent businessman, but in reality Claire knows firsthand that he's a menacing, controlling captor with very strict rules: do as you're told, public failure is not an option, and appearances are of the utmost importance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Captivate the captor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To fit together the pieces of the puzzle, Claire must follow his rules. Will her plan work, or will Anthony become enthralled by Claire's beauty, resilience, and determination, changing the game forever? If that happens, will either of them survive the consequences?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nobody ever did or ever will escape the consequences of his choices.--&lt;strong&gt;Alfred A. Montapert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>I'm writing this because you begged. You know how I love the begging. In fact, you probably know too many things and know them far too well. Who am I? Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out. I was a whore in my youth, a killer since my adolescence, and a monster as a man. I am the man who kidnapped Livvie. I am the man who held her in a dark room for weeks. But, most importantly, I am the man she loves. She loves me. It's quite sick, isn't it? Of course, there's more to our story than can be surmised in a few short sentences, but I'm at a loss for justifying my behavior back then. I assume if you're reading this, I don't need to make those justifications. You've already made your own. You're reading this because you want to know about the rest of the story. You want to know what happened that warm summer night in September of 2010, the night I met Livvie at The Paseo. It was the night my life changed all over again. It didn't happen exactly as Livvie said. She's been very kind to me in the retelling of our story. The truth is far more...complicated.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Lovely Bones&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a family devastated by a gruesome murder -- a murder recounted by the teenage victim.  Upsetting, you say?  Remarkably, first-time novelist Alice Sebold takes this difficult material and delivers a compelling and accomplished exploration of a fractured family's need for peace and closure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The details of the crime are laid out in the first few pages: from her vantage point in heaven, Susie Salmon describes how she was confronted by the murderer one December afternoon on her way home from school.  Lured into an underground hiding place, she was raped and killed.  But what the reader knows, her family does not.  Anxiously, we keep vigil with Susie, aching for her grieving family, desperate for the killer to be found and punished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sebold creates a heaven that's calm and comforting, a place whose residents can have whatever they enjoyed when they were alive -- and then some.  But Susie isn't ready to release her hold on life just yet, and she intensely watches her family and friends as they struggle to cope with a reality in which she is no longer a part.  To her great credit, Sebold has shaped one of the most loving and sympathetic fathers in contemporary literature.</description>

  <description>From the author of the&lt;em&gt; New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Eleanor &amp;amp; Park&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A coming-of-age tale of fan fiction, family and first love.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cath is a Simon Snow fan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for Cath, being a fan is her life—and she’s really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it’s what got them through their mother leaving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cath’s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can’t let go. She doesn’t want to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that they’re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn’t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She’s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words... And she can’t stop worrying about her dad, who’s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Cath, the question is: Can she do this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; "Touching and utterly real." — &lt;em&gt; Publisher's Weekly &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Se spune că, atunci când citeşti unele cărţi, nu poţi sau nu ştii cum să vezi şi să treci dincolo de coperţi, dincolo de aparenţe, dincolo de cuvinte. Unele cărţi sunt aşa, iar altele sunt altfel. Sunt cărţi care te fac să pătrunzi cu paşi timizi şi mici, în lumea şi în sufletul celui care le-a scris. Iar cartea Fluturi este o invitaţie în universul unui suflet. Povestea începe oarecum timid, ca să continue cu paşi grăbiţi şi să sfârşească printr-o avalanşă, aparent haotică, a tot ceea ce înseamnă şi poate aduce iubirea în viaţa unui om: fluturii iubirii, fericire fără margini, lacrimi şi amărăciune, dezamăgire şi resemnare.</description>

  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media--as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents--the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter--but is he really a killer? &lt;br&gt; As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?</description>

  <description>Velveteen Monroe is dead. At 16, she was kidnapped and murdered by a madman named Bonesaw. But that’s not the problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is she landed in purgatory. And while it’s not a fiery inferno, it’s certainly no heaven. It’s gray, ashen, and crumbling more and more by the day, and everyone has a job to do. Which doesn’t leave Velveteen much time to do anything about what’s really on her mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bonesaw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Velveteen aches to deliver the bloody punishment her killer deserves. And she’s figured out just how to do it. She’ll haunt him for the rest of his days. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’ll be brutal... and awesome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But crossing the divide between the living and the dead has devastating consequences. Velveteen’s obsessive haunting cracks the foundations of purgatory and jeopardizes her very soul. A risk she’s willing to take—except fate has just given her reason to stick around: an unreasonably hot and completely off-limits coworker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Velveteen can’t help herself when it comes to breaking rules... or getting revenge. And she just might be angry enough to take everyone down with her.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed.  Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it.  District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>An international sensation, this hilarious, feel-good novel is narrated by an oddly charming and socially challenged genetics professor on an unusual quest: to find out if he is capable of true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don Tillman, professor of genetics, has never been on a second date. He is a man who can count all his friends on the fingers of one hand, whose lifelong difficulty with social rituals has convinced him that he is simply not wired for romance. So when an acquaintance informs him that he would make a “wonderful” husband, his first reaction is shock. Yet he must concede to the statistical probability that there is someone for everyone, and he embarks upon The Wife Project. In the orderly, evidence-based manner with which he approaches all things, Don sets out to find the perfect partner. She will be punctual and logical—most definitely not a barmaid, a smoker, a drinker, or a late-arriver.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet Rosie Jarman is all these things. She is also beguiling, fiery, intelligent—and on a quest of her own. She is looking for her biological father, a search that a certain DNA expert might be able to help her with. Don's Wife Project takes a back burner to the Father Project and an unlikely relationship blooms, forcing the scientifically minded geneticist to confront the spontaneous whirlwind that is Rosie—and the realization that love is not always what looks good on paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rosie Project&lt;/em&gt; is a moving and hilarious novel for anyone who has ever tenaciously gone after life or love in the face of overwhelming challenges.</description>

  <description>Virginia, 1852. Seventeen-year-old Josephine Bell decides to run from the failing tobacco farm where she is a slave and nurse to her ailing mistress, the aspiring artist Lu Anne Bell. New York City, 2004. Lina Sparrow, an ambitious first-year associate in an elite law firm, is given a difficult, highly sensitive assignment that could make her career: she must find the “perfect plaintiff” to lead a historic class-action lawsuit worth trillions of dollars in reparations for descendants of American slaves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is through her father, the renowned artist Oscar Sparrow, that Lina discovers Josephine Bell and a controversy roiling the art world: are the iconic paintings long ascribed to Lu Anne Bell really the work of her house slave, Josephine? A descendant of Josephine’s would be the perfect face for the reparations lawsuit—if Lina can find one. While following the runaway girl’s faint trail through old letters and plantation records, Lina finds herself questioning her own family history and the secrets that her father has never revealed: How did Lina’s mother die? And why will he never speak about her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving between antebellum Virginia and modern-day New York, this searing, suspenseful and heartbreaking tale of art and history, love and secrets, explores what it means to repair a wrong and asks whether truth is sometimes more important than justice.</description>

  <description>Sage Singer befriends an old man who's particularly beloved in her community. Josef Weber is everyone's favorite retired teacher and Little League coach. They strike up a friendship at the bakery where Sage works. One day he asks Sage for a favor: to kill him. Shocked, Sage refuses... and then he confesses his darkest secret—he deserves to die, because he was a Nazi SS guard. Complicating the matter? Sage's grandmother is a Holocaust survivor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you do when evil lives next door? Can someone who's committed a truly heinous act ever atone for it with subsequent good behavior? Should you offer forgiveness to someone if you aren't the party who was wronged? And most of all—if Sage even considers his request—is it murder, or justice?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An unforgettable novel about finding a lost piece of yourself in someone else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Khaled Hosseini, the #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;–bestselling author of The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, has written a new novel about how we love, how we take care of one another, and how the choices we make resonate through generations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this tale revolving around not just parents and children but brothers and sisters, cousins and caretakers, Hosseini explores the many ways in which families nurture, wound, betray, honor, and sacrifice for one another; and how often we are surprised by the actions of those closest to us, at the times that matter most. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following its characters and the ramifications of their lives and choices and loves around the globe—from Kabul to Paris to San Francisco to the Greek island of Tinos—the story expands gradually outward, becoming more emotionally complex and powerful with each turning page.</description>

  <description>The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. "World War Z" is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, "By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.  Eyewitness reports from the first truly global war&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Kiki este o tinara nonconformista, incapabila sa aleaga intre viata alaturi de un artist megaloman, Renato, si iubirea pentru o alta fata, Alex. Coplesita de temeri, nevroze si viziuni romantice, unele aflate la granita dintre reverie si boala, ea frecventeaza mediile studentesti si artistice, in cautarea unui raspuns la dilemele sale. In aceasta continua oscilatie intre hetero- si homosexualitate, Kiki traieste insa o serie de experiente in urma carora viziunile sale devin mai puternice decit realitatea. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roman ecranizat in 2006 in regia lui Tudor Giurgiu</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games.  She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive.  Katniss should be relieved, happy even.  After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale.  Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be.  Gale holds her at an icy distance.  Peeta has turned his back on her completely.  And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop.  And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try.  As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever.  If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/em&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue--Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is--she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are--and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, Tris also learns that her secret might help her save the ones she loves . . . or it might destroy her.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the 2012 Schneider Family Book Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jessica thinks her life is over when she loses a leg in a car accident. She's not comforted by the news that she'll be able to walk with the help of a prosthetic leg. Who cares about walking when you live to run?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she struggles to cope with crutches and a first cyborg-like prosthetic, Jessica feels oddly both in the spotlight and invisible. People who don't know what to say, act like she's not there. Which she could handle better if she weren't now keenly aware that she'd done the same thing herself to a girl with CP named Rosa. A girl who is going to tutor her through all the math she's missed. A girl who sees right into the heart of her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the support of family, friends, a coach, and her track teammates, Jessica may actually be able to run again. But that's not enough for her now. She doesn't just want to cross finish lines herself—she wants to take Rosa with her.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winning will make you famous. &lt;br&gt;Losing means certain death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts. Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games. In punishment, and as a reminder of the power and grace of the Capitol, each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 through a lottery system to participate in the games. The 'tributes' are chosen during the annual Reaping and are forced to fight to the death, leaving only one survivor to claim victory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. , she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature.</description>

  <description>Get the business leader's guide to using Twitter to gain competitive advantage.Since 2006, forward-thinking companies like Apple, JetBlue, Whole Foods, and GM have discovered the instant benefits of leveraging the social media phenomenon known as Twitter to reach consumers directly, build their brand, and increase sales. Twitter is at the leading edge of the social media movement, allowing members to connect with one another in real time via short text messages?called "tweets"?that can be received either via the Twitter site or by e-mail, instant messenger, or cell phone. Many companies have started building entire teams within their organization dedicated solely to responding to tweets from consumers about their brand. And this is just the beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In "Twitter Power," Internet marketing and Web innovation expert Joel Comm shows businesses and marketers how to integrate Twitter into their existing marketing strategies to build a loyal following among Twitter members, expand awareness for their product or service, and even handle negative publicity due to angry or disappointed consumers. The book also presents case studies of companies on the forefront of the Twitter movement, to help you develop your own social networking strategies. "Twitter Power" is the result of extensive testing and participation in the social networking community and is a must-have for any business that wants to keep up with the social media movement. "Twitter Power" features a foreword by Tony Robbins.</description>

  <description>A tribe is any group of people, large or small, who are connected to one another, a leader, and an idea. For millions of years, humans have been seeking out tribes, be they religious, ethnic, economic, political, or even musical (think of the Deadheads). It's our nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the Internet has eliminated the barriers of geography, cost, and time. All those blogs and social networking sites are helping existing tribes get bigger. But more important, they're enabling countless new tribes to be born—groups of ten or ten thousand or ten million who care about their iPhones, or a political campaign, or a new way to fight global warming.&lt;br&gt;And so the key question: Who is going to lead us?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Web can do amazing things, but it can't provide leadership. That still has to come from individuals—people just like you who have passion about something. The explosion in tribes means that anyone who wants to make a difference now has the tools at her fingertips.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you think leadership is for other people, think again—leaders come in surprising packages. Consider Joel Spolsky and his international tribe of scary-smart software engineers. Or Gary Vaynerhuck, a wine expert with a devoted following of enthusiasts. Chris Sharma leads a tribe of rock climbers up impossible cliff faces, while Mich Mathews, a VP at Microsoft, runs her internal tribe of marketers from her cube in Seattle. All they have in common is the desire to change things, the ability to connect a tribe, and the willingness to lead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you ignore this opportunity, you risk turning into a "sheepwalker"—someone who fights to protect the status quo at all costs, never asking if obedience is doing you (or your organization) any good. Sheepwalkers don't do very well these days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tribes will make you think (really think) about the opportunities in leading your fellow employees, customers, investors, believers, hobbyists, or readers. . . . It's not easy, but it's easier than you think.&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media--as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents--the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter--but is he really a killer? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?</description>

  <description>When reserved flight attendant Bianca gets one look at billionaire hotel owner James Cavendish, she loses all of her hard-won composure. For a girl who can easily juggle a tray of champagne flutes at 35,000 feet in three inch heels, she finds herself shockingly weak-kneed from their first encounter. The normally unruffled Bianca can't seem to look away from his electrifying turquoise gaze. They hold a challenge, and a promise, that she finds impossible to resist, and she is a girl who is used to saying no and meaning it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bianca is accustomed to dealing with supermodels and movie stars in her job as a first class flight attendant, but James Cavendish puts them all to shame in the looks department. If only it were just his looks that she found so irresistible about the intimidating man, Bianca could have ignored his attentions. But what tempts her like never before is the dominant pull he seems to have over her from the moment they meet, and the promise of pleasure, and pain, that she reads in his eyes.</description>

  <description>Caleb is a man with a singular interest in revenge. Kidnapped as a young boy and sold into slavery by a power-hungry mobster, he has thought of nothing but vengeance. For twelve years he has immersed himself in the world of pleasure slaves searching for the one man he holds ultimately responsible. Finally, the architect of his suffering has emerged with a new identity, but not a new nature. If Caleb is to get close enough to strike, he must become the very thing he abhors and kidnap a beautiful girl to train her to be all that he once was.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eighteen-year-old Olivia Ruiz has just woken up in a strange place. Blindfolded and bound, there is only a calm male voice to welcome her. His name is Caleb, though he demands to be called Master. Olivia is young, beautiful, naïve and willful to a fault. She has a dark sensuality that cannot be hidden or denied, though she tries to accomplish both. Although she is frightened by the strong, sadistic, and arrogant man who holds her prisoner, what keeps Olivia awake in the dark is her unwelcome attraction to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WARNING: This book contains very disturbing situations, dubious consent, strong language, and graphic violence.</description>

In this hilarious debut novel, Victoria Michaels brings us a colorful and relatable cast of characters.

  <description>As the application of object technology--particularly the Java programming language--has become commonplace, a new problem has emerged to confront the software development community. Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, non-optimal applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as refactoring, these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process. With proper training a skilled system designe</description>

  <description>My name is Evie Claremont and this was to be the making of me–my freshman year of college. I’d been hoping that once I’d arrived on Crestwood’s campus, the nightmare that I’ve been having would go away. It hasn’t.&lt;br&gt;I may be an inexperienced seventeen-year-old, but I’m grounded…sane. I look for rational explanations to even the strangest circumstances. Since meeting sophomore Reed Wellington, however, nothing makes any sense. Whenever he’s near, I feel an attraction to him–a magnetic kind of force pulling me towards him. I know what you’re thinking…that sounds fairly awesome. Yeah, it would be…if he liked me, but Reed acts as if I’m the worst thing that has ever happened to Crestwood…or him. But get this, for some reason every time I turn around he’s there, barging into my life.&lt;br&gt;What is the secret that he’s keeping from me? I’m hoping that it’s anything but what I suspect: that he’s not exactly normal…and neither am I. So, maybe Crestwood won’t be the making of me, but it could be the breaking of me. I’ve been left to wonder if the dark future my dream is foretelling is…inescapable.</description>

  <description>„În centrul cărților lui Octavian Paler nu se află nici sfântul, nici bruta absolută, nici supraomul nietzschean, ci omul obișnuit, sumă de calități și defecte, patimi și slăbiciuni, îndoieli și angoase. Oricine se poate așadar proiecta sau regăsi în paginile acestui roman. Fiindcă pe peron nu este El, eroul exemplar ieșit din seria biologica. Pe peron suntem noi. Oricine se poate recunoaște în omul care își caută, prin smârcurile existenței și dincoace de linia deșertului morții, un drum salvator. Aceste calități ale cărții sunt suficiente pentru a înscrie „Viața pe un peron” în rândul operelor reprezentative ale literaturii noastre postbelice.” (Daniel Cristea-Enache)</description>

  <description>Warning: This is not a "typical love story". This is an all-consuming, soul-crushing, tear-your-heart-into-pieces story. It’s intense, gritty and raw, dark and disturbing, and it doesn’t happen overnight. This is an epic love story that knows no boundaries and has no time limits. It grows and develops—with hurt, sacrifice, and heartache—over the span of a lifetime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva Fox is the princess of the Silver Demons Motorcycle Club. Growing up with bikers in the club lifestyle is all that she knows. When she’s a young girl, Eva meets the reason for her existence. Deuce West is the sexy, biker bad-ass of the Hell’s Horsemen Motorcycle Club. Like Eva, he was born and raised in the club—but that’s where the similarities end. Their first meeting is innocent, but as Eva matures into a woman, their chance reunions evolve into a fit of lust and love. Fate continues to bring them together time and time again, but their twisted journey is filled with pain, betrayal, and bloodshed that could tear them apart. Eva sees in Deuce what he cannot see in himself—a man worthy of love—and Eva spends her lifetime proving to him that her undeniable love is the one thing he can’t live without.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Eva and Deuce’s story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wasn’t easy. &lt;br&gt;Nothing worth doing ever is.&lt;br&gt;And love is worth everything.</description>

  <description>Sydney Taylor Award-winning novel &lt;em&gt;Berlin Boxing Club&lt;/em&gt; is loosely inspired by the true story of boxer Max Schmeling's experiences following Kristallnacht.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Karl Stern has never thought of himself as a Jew. But the bullies at his school in Nazi-era Berlin, don't care that Karl has never been in a synagogue or that his family doesn't practice religion. Demoralized by attacks on a heritage he doesn't accept as his own, Karl longs to prove his worth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when Max Schmeling, champion boxer and German national hero, makes a deal with Karl's father to give Karl boxing lessons, A skilled cartoonist, Karl has never had an interest in boxing, but now it seems like the perfect chance to reinvent himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Nazi violence against Jews escalates, Karl must take on a new role: protector of his family. And as Max's fame forces him to associate with Hitler and other Nazi elites, Karl begins to wonder where his hero's sympathies truly lie. Can Karl balance his dream of boxing greatness with his obligation to keep his family out of harm's way?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Includes an author's note and sources page detailing the factual inspirations behind the novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Supports the Common Core State Standards.</description>

  <description>The Hematoi descend from the unions of gods and mortals, and the children of two Hematoi pure bloods have godlike powers. Children of Hematoi and mortals--well, not so much. Half-bloods only have two options: become trained Sentinels who hunt and kill daimons or become servants in the homes of the pures. Seventeen-year-old Alexandria would rather risk her life fighting than waste it scrubbing toilets, but she may end up slumming it anyway. There are several rules that students at the Covenant must follow. Alex has problems with them all, but especially rule #1:Relationships between pures and halfs are forbidden. Unfortunately, she's crushing hard on the totally hot pure-blood Aiden. But falling for Aiden isn't her biggest problem--staying alive long enough to graduate the Covenant and become a Sentinel is. If she fails in her duty, she faces a future worse than death or slavery: being turned into a daimon, and being hunted by Aiden. And that would kind of suck.</description>

  <description>Maggie is a seventeen year old girl who's had a bad year. She was smart and on track, but then her mom left, her dad is depressed, she's graduating - barely - and her boyfriend of almost three years dumped her for a college football scholarship. Lately she thinks life is all about hanging on by a thread and is gripping tight with everything she has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she saves the life of Caleb and instantly knows there's something about him that's intriguing. But things change when they touch, sparks ignite. Literally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They imprint with each other and she sees their future life together flash before her eyes. She learns that not only is she his soul mate, and can feel his heartbeat in her chest, but there is a whole other world of people with gifts and abilities that she never knew existed. She herself is experiencing supernatural changes unlike anything she's ever felt before and she needs the touch of his skin to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, not only has her dad come out of his depression to be a father again, and a pain as well, but Caleb's enemies know he's imprinted and are after Maggie to stop them both from gaining their abilities and take her from him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Caleb save her or will they be forced to live without each other after just finding one another?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;To survive in a ruined world, she must embrace the darkness…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Allison Sekemoto survives in the Fringe, the outermost circle of a walled-in city. By day, she and her crew scavenge for food. By night, any one of them could be eaten. Some days, all that drives Allie is her hatred of&lt;em&gt; them&lt;/em&gt;—the vampires who keep humans as blood cattle. Until the night Allie herself dies and becomes one of the monsters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forced to flee her city, Allie must pass for human as she joins a ragged group of pilgrims seeking a legend—a place that might have a cure for the disease that killed off most of civilization and created the rabids, the bloodthirsty creatures who threaten human and vampire alike. And soon Allie will have to decide what and who is worth dying for… again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Julie Kagawa's dark and twisted world as an unforgettable journey begins.</description>

  <description>A boy named Seth drowns, desperate and alone in his final moments, losing his life as the pounding sea claims him. But then he wakes. He is naked, thirsty, starving. But alive. How is that possible? He &lt;em&gt;remembers&lt;/em&gt; dying, his bones breaking, his skull dashed upon the rocks. So how is he here? And where is this place? The street seems familiar, but everything is abandoned, overgrown, covered in dust. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's going on? Is it real? Or has he woken up in his own personal hell? Seth begins to search for answers, hoping desperately that there must be more to this life, or perhaps this afterlife...</description>

  <description>Katy knows the world changed the night the Luxen came.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She can't believe Daemon welcomed his race or stood by as his kind threatened to obliterate every last human and hybrid on Earth. But the lines between good and bad have blurred, and love has become an emotion that could destroy her—could destroy them all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daemon will do anything to save those he loves, even if it means betrayal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They must team with an unlikely enemy if there is any chance of surviving the invasion. But when it quickly becomes impossible to tell friend from foe, and the world is crumbling around them, they may lose everything— even what they cherish most—to ensure the survival of their friends…and mankind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;War has come to Earth. And no matter the outcome, the future will never be the same for those left standing.</description>

  <description>The last thing Dawson Black expected was Bethany Williams. As a Luxen, an alien life form on Earth, human girls are…well, fun. But since the Luxen have to keep their true identities a secret, falling for one would be insane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dangerous. Tempting. Undeniable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bethany can’t deny the immediate connection between her and Dawson. And even though boys aren’t a complication she wants, she can’t stay away from him. Still, whenever they lock eyes, she’s drawn in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captivated. Lured. Loved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dawson is keeping a secret that will change her existence...and put her life in jeopardy. But even he can’t stop risking everything for one human girl. Or from a fate that is as unavoidable as love itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Daemon will do anything to get Katy back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the successful but disastrous raid on Mount Weather, he’s facing the impossible. Katy is gone. Taken. Everything becomes about finding her. Taking out anyone who stands in his way? Done. Burning down the whole world to save her? Gladly. Exposing his alien race to the world? With pleasure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Katy can do is survive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surrounded by enemies, the only way she can come out of this is to adapt. After all, there are sides of Daedalus that don’t seem entirely crazy, but the group’s goals are frightening and the truths they speak even more disturbing. Who are the real bad guys? Daedalus? Mankind? Or the Luxen?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Together, they can face anything.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the most dangerous foe has been there all along, and when the truths are exposed and the lies come crumbling down, which side will Daemon and Katy be standing on? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And will they even be together?&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>After everything, I’m no longer the same Katy. I’m different... And I’m not sure what that will mean in the end. When each step we take in discovering the truth puts us in the path of the secret organization responsible for torturing and testing hybrids, the more I realize there is no end to what I’m capable of. The death of someone close still lingers, help comes from the most unlikely source, and friends will become the deadliest of enemies, but we won’t turn back. Even if the outcome will shatter our worlds forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Together we’re stronger... and they know it.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Being connected to Daemon Black sucks…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daemon’s determined to prove what he feels for me is more than a product of our bizarre connection. I’ve sworn him off even though he’s running more hot than cold these days. But against all common sense, I’m falling for him. Hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our relationship issues aren’t out biggest problem…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Department of Defense is here. If they ever find out what Daemon can do and that we’re linked, I’m a goner. So is he. And when a new boy shows up a school with a secret of his own, things get complicated fast. I need to choose between my own instincts and Daemon’s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then everything changes…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve seen someone who shouldn’t be alive. Daemon’s never going to stop searching until gets the truth. What happened to his brother? Who betrayed him? And what does the DOD want from them—from me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one is who they seem. And not everyone will survive the lies.</description>

  <description>Over the past three and a half decades, Marina Abramovic's astonishing oeuvre, with pieces in which she performs feats of extreme endurance or mortification of the flesh, has laid bare--perhaps more than any other artist has done--the human body's strengths, limitations, vulnerabilities and complex bouquet of meanings. In addition, her projects have simultaneously provoked and deflected intense curiosity about "who" could possibly want to publicly subject herself to such agonizing conditions: who, in short, is Marina Abramovic? In this revealing set of conversations--conducted in train stations, hotels, galleries and her own private studio--between Abramovic and curator Hans Ulrich Obrist, with the occasional addition of other interlocutors including Gustav Metzger (the "Old Master of action art"), the artist talks about her work, the strict discipline of her Yugoslav childhood and the process of preparing for her epochal retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Meghan Chase has a secret destiny; one she could never have imagined.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something has always felt slightly off in Meghan's life, ever since her father disappeared before her eyes when she was six. She has never quite fit in at school or at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a dark stranger begins watching her from afar, and her prankster best friend becomes strangely protective of her, Meghan senses that everything she's known is about to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she could never have guessed the truth - that she is the daughter of a mythical faery king and is a pawn in a deadly war. Now Meghan will learn just how far she'll go to save someone she cares about, to stop a mysterious evil, no faery creature dare face; and to find love with a young prince who might rather see her dead than let her touch his icy heart.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Delta of Venus&lt;/em&gt; Anaïs Nin penned a lush, magical world where the characters of her imagination possess the most universal of desires and exceptional of talents. Among these provocative stories, a Hungarian adventurer seduces wealthy women then vanishes with their money; a veiled woman selects strangers from a chic restaurant for private trysts; and a Parisian hatmaker named Mathilde leaves her husband for the opium dens of Peru. &lt;em&gt;Delta of Venus&lt;/em&gt; is an extraordinarily rich and exotic collection from the master of erotic writing.</description>

  <description>When Jade is given a scholarship to an elite private college in Connecticut, she sees it as a chance to finally escape her painful past and get a fresh start. She’s determined to succeed and that means keeping her focus on school and not guys. But her plan falls apart her first day on campus when Garret, a rich prep school boy with swimmer abs and a perfect smile, offers to help her move in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jade tries to push him away, but she can’t deny her attraction to him and Garret won’t let her. Things quickly heat up between them, but then come to a sudden halt when reality hits and Jade realizes that a relationship with Garret may never be possible. He comes from a world of wealth where there are rules, including rules about who he can date. And not following those rules has consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the two of them try to overcome the obstacles working to keep them apart, Jade is confronted with another challenge. On her 19th birthday, she receives a letter that her now deceased mother wrote years ago. In it are revelations that explain her traumatic childhood but also make her question the past she’s been running from.</description>

  <description>Ana Belle never wanted anything more than to hang up her apron, jump on her Vespa and ride off into the sunset, leaving Sugartown in the dust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elijah Cade never wanted anything more than a hot meal, a side of hot arse and a soft place to lay his head at night where he could forget about his past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But you know what they say about wanting: you always want what you can’t have.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nineteen year-old virgin Ana is about to discover that’s not quite true because a six foot three, hotter than hell, tattooed, Aussie sex god just rode into town. He’s had a taste of her pie and he wants more– no really, Ana bakes pies for a living, get your mind out of the gutter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’d be willing to hand over everything tied up in a big red bow, there’s just one problem; Elijah has secrets dirtier than last week’s underwear. Secrets that won't just break Ana’s heart, but put her life at risk, too. When those secrets come to light, their relationship is pushed to breaking point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Add to that a psychotic nympho best friend, an overbearing father, a cuter than humanly possible kid brother, a wanton womanizing cousin, the ex from hell, and more pies than you could poke a ... err ... stick ... at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And you thought small towns were boring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Sugartown.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Intended for a mature 18+ audience. Contains explicit sex, oodles of profanity and a crap-tonne of AWKWARD.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>She knew that she was ready to do what must be done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emily Eldritch has known for all of her thirty-nine years that she is not who she is meant to be. Now, in an anonymous hotel in Mid-Town Manhattan, she faces the truth of her ruined life; a husband who does not love her, a child she believes she is not fit to care for, and a grief that has never been faced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet, in her final hours, something calls to her, reliving the events that have so reduced her… and offering her an impossible alternative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Emily must choose whether to continue in this world, or take her chances in the next.</description>

  <description>(Author note: This is NOT a dark romance.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delilah “Lily” Flynn is used to her drab existence. Lily’s been living it for twenty two years. &lt;br&gt;Her boring life is suddenly turned on its head when she’s rudely kidnapped from her bedroom.&lt;br&gt;Or so she thinks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nox Taylor is far too high up in his field to be assigned a babysitting job. &lt;br&gt;There’s nothing more he wants than to complete his mission so he can be rid of the smartass tomboy, Lily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Day after day, Nox watches Lily and her strange ways. She’s unlike any woman he’s ever met. &lt;br&gt;Getting close to the girl is purely for her own protection…right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily never imagined she’d make her first real friends in captivity. &lt;br&gt;What lengths would she go through to keep them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**This is a stand alone novel and is unrelated to Friend-Zoned**</description>

  <description>For Annie Phillips, there is a right way to do things and everything has a place. College and her flawless GPA are top priority, as is planning her perfect future. Anything less than perfection is unacceptable. So when she meets Loden Guiles, she believes she has finally found her perfect happily-ever-after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chase Malloy is funny, loyal, and an all around nice guy. He’s also sloppy, tattooed, and undirected. All Chase wants to do is survive college, hang out with friends, and make music. Knowing his best friend’s step-sister since they were fourteen, Annie and he have always had a love-hate relationship.  The last thing Chase expects is to fall for Annie, but he knows he’ll never live up to her idea of the perfect man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the outside, Annie and Loden’s relationship appears picture perfect. But behind closed doors, Annie quickly realizes Loden isn’t the man he pretends to be.  Every time her not so well laid plans crumble, and Loden proves to be not so Mr. Right, Chase is there to pick her up and brush her off.  Will she realize the perfection she’s been searching for has been in front of her all this time?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Long After is a companion novel to Sometimes Never and Before Now. Many of the same characters appear in Chase and Annie's story. However, it can be read as a stand-alone book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**This is a new adult novel. Due to harsh language, sexual situations, and violence, this book is recommended for 17+.</description>

  <description>Harper Price, peerless Southern belle, was born ready for a Homecoming tiara. But after a strange run-in at the dance imbues her with incredible abilities, Harper's destiny takes a turn for the seriously weird. She becomes a Paladin, one of an ancient line of guardians with agility, super strength and lethal fighting instincts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when life can't get any more disastrously crazy, Harper finds out who she's charged to protect: David Stark, school reporter, subject of a mysterious prophecy and possibly Harper's least favorite person. But things get complicated when Harper starts falling for him—and discovers that David's own fate could very well be to destroy Earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With snappy banter, cotillion dresses, non-stop action and a touch of magic, this new young adult series from bestseller Rachel Hawkins is going to make y'all beg for more.</description>

  <description>Fifteen-year-old Izzy Brannick was trained to fight monsters. For centuries, her family has hunted magical creatures. But when Izzy’s older sister vanishes without a trace while on a job, Izzy's mom decides they need to take a break.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Izzy and her mom move to a new town, but they soon discover it’s not as normal as it appears. A series of hauntings has been plaguing the local high school, and Izzy is determined to prove her worth and investigate. But assuming the guise of an average teenager is easier said than done. For a tough girl who's always been on her own, it’s strange to suddenly make friends and maybe even have a crush.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Izzy trust her new friends to help find the secret behind the hauntings before more people get hurt? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachel Hawkins' delightful spin-off brings the same wit and charm as the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; best-selling Hex Hall series. Get ready for more magic, mystery and romance!</description>

  <description>Sienna Jensen had no plans to return home when she graduated college last spring—after all, her dreams lie in California. But when she discovers her grandmother’s Nashville home has been foreclosed, and the new owner has started the eviction process, Sienna has no other choice but go back to Music City. And she comes face to face with the flawed, gorgeous man she never thought she’d see again. The man who now holds the deed to her grandma’s estate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When millionaire rock star Lucas Wolfe finds the outspoken redhead glaring at him from across a courtroom, he’s both infuriated and intrigued. He still can't get the night Sienna almost spent with him out of his mind, and the chemistry between them is as undeniable as it was two years ago. He craves Sienna more than ever. And just like everything Lucas hungers for, he’s determined to have her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Lucas will do whatever it takes to lure Sienna into his bed, even if that means making a deal with her: ten days with him, playing by his rules, and he’ll hand over the deed to her grandmother’s home. Though she agrees to the arrangement, Sienna is conflicted. Because of her duty to her family. Because of promises she’s made to herself and a past that still haunts her. And as Lucas’s game of seduction continues, and Sienna is introduced to his dark, erotic world and even darker background, she realizes that at any moment, she could be devoured.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;*This novel contains adult situations and content*&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Night time is the right time...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gwendolyn Kidd has met the man of her dreams. He's hot, he's sexy, and what started as a no-names-exchanged night of passion has blossomed into a year and a half-long pleasure fest. Sure, it's a little strange that he only appears in her bed at night, but Gwen is so sure he's the one, she just can't turn him away... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hawk Delgado knows more about Gwen than she could ever imagine. She's gorgeous, headstrong, and skittish about relationships. But Hawk is facing his own demons, demons that keep him from connecting with anyone. Yet when Gwen is drawn into Denver's lethal underground scene, Hawk's protective nature comes out full force. The problem is, when Gwen gets a dose of Hawk's Alpha attitude in the daylight, she's not so sure he's the one anymore....</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I'm dreaming of the boy in the tree. I tell him stories. About the Jellicoe School and the Townies and the Cadets from a school in Sydney. I tell him about the war between us for territory. And I tell him about Hannah, who lives in the unfinished house by the river. Hannah, who is too young to be hiding away from the world. Hannah, who found me on the Jellicoe Road six years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taylor is leader of the boarders at the Jellicoe School. She has to keep the upper hand in the territory wars and deal with Jonah Griggs - the enigmatic leader of the cadets, and someone she thought she would never see again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now Hannah, the person Taylor had come to rely on, has disappeared. Taylor's only clue is a manuscript about five kids who lived in Jellicoe eighteen years ago. She needs to find out more, but this means confronting her own story, making sense of her strange, recurring dream, and finding her mother - who abandoned her on the Jellicoe Road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moving, joyous and brilliantly compelling new novel from the best-selling, multi-award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;Looking for Alibrandi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Saving Francesca&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>“Dead girl walking”, the boys say in the halls.&lt;br&gt;“Tell us your secret”, the girls whisper, one toilet to another.&lt;br&gt;I am that girl.&lt;br&gt;I am the space between my thighs, daylight shining through.&lt;br&gt;I am the bones they want, wired on a porcelain frame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lia and Cassie are best friends, wintergirls frozen in matchstick bodies, competitors in a deadly contest to see who can be the skinniest. But what comes after size zero and size double-zero? When Cassie succumbs to the demons within, Lia feels she is being haunted by her friend’s restless spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laurie Halse Anderson explores Lia’s descent into the powerful vortex of anorexia, and her painful path toward recovery.</description>

  <description>A compelling story of romance, family, and friendship with humor and heart, perfect for fans of Stephanie Perkins and Lauren Myracle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Francesca is stuck at St. Sebastian’s, a boys' school that pretends it's coed by giving the girls their own bathroom.  Her only female companions are an ultra-feminist, a rumored slut, and an impossibly dorky accordion player.  The boys are no better, from Thomas, who specializes in musical burping, to Will, the perpetually frowning, smug moron that Francesca can't seem to stop thinking about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there's Francesca's mother, who always thinks she knows what's best for Francesca—until she is suddenly stricken with acute depression, leaving Francesca lost, alone, and without an inkling of who she really is.  Simultaneously humorous, poignant, and impossible to put down, this is the story of a girl who must summon the strength to save her family, her social life and—hardest of all—herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the Hardcover edition.</description>

  <description>Ambitious New York City teenager Craig Gilner is determined to succeed at life - which means getting into the right high school to get into the right job. But once Craig aces his way into Manhattan's Executive Pre-Professional High School, the pressure becomes unbearable. He stops eating and sleeping until, one night, he nearly kills himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Craig's suicidal episode gets him checked into a mental hospital, where his new neighbors include a transsexual sex addict, a girl who has scarred her own face with scissors, and the self-elected President Armelio. There, Craig is finally able to confront the sources of his anxiety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ned Vizzini, who himself spent time in a psychiatric hospital, has created a remarkably moving tale about the sometimes unexpected road to happiness.</description>

  <description>Sophie Mercer thought she was a witch. That was the whole reason she was sent to Hex Hall, a reform school for delinquent Prodigium (a.k.a. witches, shape-shifters, and faeries). But then she discovered the family secret, and the fact that her hot crush, Archer Cross, is an agent for The Eye, a group bent on wiping Prodigium off the face of the earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out, Sophie's a demon, one of only two in the world-the other being her father. What's worse, she has powers that threaten the lives of everyone she loves. Which is precisely why Sophie decides she must go to London for the Removal, a dangerous procedure that will either destroy her powers for good-or kill her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But once Sophie arrives, she makes a shocking discovery. Her new housemates? They're demons too. Meaning, someone is raising demons in secret, with creepy plans to use their powers, and probably not for good. Meanwhile, The Eye is set on hunting Sophie down, and they're using Archer to do it. But it's not like she has feelings for him anymore. Does she?</description>

  <description>Hailed as “impossible to put down,” the Hex Hall series has both critics and teens cheering. With a winning combination of romance, action, magic and humor, this third volume will leave readers enchanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as Sophie Mercer has come to accept her extraordinary magical powers as a demon, the Prodigium Council strips them away. Now Sophie is defenseless, alone, and at the mercy of her sworn enemies—the Brannicks, a family of warrior women who hunt down the Prodigium. Or at least that’s what Sophie thinks, until she makes a surprising discovery. The Brannicks know an epic war is coming, and they believe Sophie is the only one powerful enough to stop the world from ending. But without her magic, Sophie isn’t as confident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sophie’s bound for one hell of a ride—can she get her powers back before it’s too late?</description>

  <description>Three years ago, Sophie Mercer discovered that she was a witch. It's gotten her into a few scrapes. Her non-gifted mother has been as supportive as possible, consulting Sophie's estranged father—an elusive European warlock—only when necessary. But when Sophie attracts too much human attention for a prom-night spell gone horribly wrong, it's her dad who decides her punishment: exile to Hex Hall, an isolated reform school for wayward Prodigium, a.k.a. witches, faeries, and shapeshifters.    &lt;p&gt;By the end of her first day among fellow freak-teens, Sophie has quite a scorecard: three powerful enemies who look like supermodels, a futile crush on a gorgeous warlock, a creepy tag-along ghost, and a new roommate who happens to be the most hated person and only vampire student on campus. Worse, Sophie soon learns that a mysterious predator has been attacking students, and her only friend is the number-one suspect.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a series of blood-curdling mysteries starts to converge, Sophie prepares for the biggest threat of all: an ancient secret society determined to destroy all Prodigium, especially her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The first in &lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Alice Clayton’s Redhead series is a playful and erotic romance between an aspiring actress and Hollywood’s hottest new leading man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Grace Sheridan returns to Los Angeles to become a working actress, it’s a second shot at a life-long dream. With some help from her best-friend agent, will that dream become a reality—or at thirty-three, has Grace missed her chance at the big time? And when an unexpected sizzling romance with Jack Hamilton, the entertainment industry's newest “it” boy, threatens to shine an uncomfortable spotlight on her life, how will that affect her career…and his?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funny, borderline neurotic Grace is perfect in her imperfections, and the sexual chemistry between her and charming yet blissfully unaware Jack is off the charts. With laugh-out-loud dialogue and a super-steamy romance that will get your heart racing, sneaking around in L.A. and dodging the paparazzi has never been so fun.</description>

  <description>Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he's asleep) toddler a better life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Carter's undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire's panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.</description>

  <description>Five months ago, Valerie Leftman's boyfriend, Nick, opened fire on their school cafeteria. Shot trying to stop him, Valerie inadvertently saved the life of a classmate, but was implicated in the shootings because of the list she helped create. A list of people and things she and Nick hated. The list he used to pick his targets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, after a summer of seclusion, Val is forced to confront her guilt as she returns to school to complete her senior year. Haunted by the memory of the boyfriend she still loves and navigating rocky relationships with her family, former friends and the girl whose life she saved, Val must come to grips with the tragedy that took place and her role in it, in order to make amends and move on with her life.</description>

  <description>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</description>

  <description>When unworldly student Anastasia Steele first encountered the driven and dazzling young entrepreneur Christian Grey it sparked a sensual affair that changed both of their lives irrevocably. Shocked, intrigued, and, ultimately, repelled by Christian’s singular erotic tastes, Ana demands a deeper commitment. Determined to keep her, Christian agrees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Ana and Christian have it all—love, passion, intimacy, wealth, and a world of possibilities for their future. But Ana knows that loving her Fifty Shades will not be easy, and that being together will pose challenges that neither of them would anticipate. Ana must somehow learn to share Christian’s opulent lifestyle without sacrificing her own identity. And Christian must overcome his compulsion to control as he wrestles with the demons of a tormented past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when it seems that their strength together will eclipse any obstacle, misfortune, malice, and fate conspire to make Ana’s deepest fears turn to reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>***This book is a spin-off of Waiting on Forever with no prior books needed to be read before it***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recent college graduate, Kayla Reynolds was ready to leave the university, sorority life behind. Leaving her boyfriend of over three years, she packed her bags and moved four hours south to the big city…New York City.  Bright lights, streets that never sleep, and a business lifestyle that she yearned to have were all at her fingertips. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kayla Reynolds was chasing her dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determined and eager to make it in the corporate world, Kayla changed everything- her image, lifestyle, and outlook on life, putting her career first and her personal life second. That was until her first day, the first time she got a glimpse of Miles Blackwell. Corporate CEO and part owner of ETV, and not to mention, incredibly handsome, Miles Blackwell took Kayla by surprise, stealing her heart as he did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But nothing had ever come that easy for Kayla. Life had always seemed to have a personal vendetta against her, stepping in when everything seemed too good to be true, reminding herself of whom she really was. It wasn’t until she met Merrick Drake that she realized when to stop; when running was no longer an option. For the first time in her life she had someone she could relate to; someone who wouldn’t judge- who saw the person she was inside. She and Merrick connected…on more levels than one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When life was too much to handle, they ran. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there was only one person that could make Kayla stop for good. Only one man that made her want to stay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would Kayla finally stop running or would it all be too much to handle?</description>

  &lt;div&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Arcadia &lt;/em&gt;takes us back and forth between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, ranging over the nature of truth and time, the difference between the Classical and the Romantic temperament, and the disruptive influence of sex on our orbits in life. Focusing on the mysteries—romantic, scientific, literary—that engage the minds and hearts of characters whose passions and lives intersect across scientific planes and centuries, it is “Stoppard’s richest, most ravishing comedy to date, a play of wit, intellect, language, brio and . . . emotion. It’s like a dream of levitation: you’re instantaneously aloft, soaring, banking, doing loop-the-loops and then, when you think you’re about to plummet to earth, swooping to a gentle touchdown of not easily described sweetness and sorrow . . . Exhilarating” (Vincent Canby, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;You're alone. You're vulnerable. And you have something that someone else wants. At any cost...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claudia Morgan-Brown finally has it all. Pregnant with a much-wanted first baby of her own, she has a happily established family of two small step-sons and a loving husband with a great career. But she is also committed to her full-time job as a social worker, and her husband travels often. So when Claudia hires Zoe to help her around the house in anticipation of the baby’s arrival, it seems like the answer to her prayers. But despite Zoe's glowing recommendations and instant rapport with the children, there's something about her that Claudia cannot trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, there has been a series of violent attacks on pregnant women in the area, and Claudia becomes acutely aware of her vulnerability. With her husband out of town for work and her family far away, who will be there to protect her? And why does she feel unsettled about Zoe? Realizing appearances can be deceiving even in her seemingly perfect world, Claudia digs deeper into Zoe’s blurry past and begins to wonder – how far would someone go to have a child of her own?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Riveting from its very first pages, &lt;strong&gt;Until You’re Mine&lt;/strong&gt; is a multilayered masterwork of twisted, psychological suspense. Readers of &lt;strong&gt;Before I Go to Sleep&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Turn of Mind&lt;/strong&gt; will be enthralled by this multilayered novel, featuring a twisted plot that ends in a breathtaking and shocking finale.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Charlie is a freshman.&lt;/strong&gt; And while he's not the biggest geek in the school, he is by no means popular. Shy, introspective, intelligent beyond his year yet socially awkward, he is a wallflower, caught between trying to live his life and trying to run from it. Charlie is attempting to navigate his way through uncharted territory: the world of first dates and mix tapes, family dramas and new friends; the world of sex, drugs, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, when all one requires is that perfect song on that perfect drive to feel infinite. But he can't stay on the sidelines forever. Standing on the fringes of life offers a unique perspective. But there comes a time to see what it looks like from the dance floor. &lt;em&gt;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&lt;/em&gt; is a deeply affecting coming-of-age story that will spirit you back to those wild and poignant roller-coaster days known as growing up.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A national bestseller—7 million copies sold.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prosecuting attorney in the Manson trial, Vincent Bugliosi held a unique insider's position in one of the most baffling and horrifying cases of the twentieth century: the cold-blooded Tate-LaBianca murders carried out by Charles Manson and four of his followers. What motivated Manson in his seemingly mindless selection of victims, and what was his hold over the young women who obeyed his orders? Here is the gripping story of this famous and haunting crime. 50 pages of b/w photographs.    &lt;p&gt;Both &lt;em&gt;Helter Skelter&lt;/em&gt; and Vincent Bugliosi's subsequent &lt;em&gt;Till Death Us Do Part&lt;/em&gt; won Edgar Allan Poe Awards for best true-crime book of the year. Bugliosi is also the author of &lt;em&gt;Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O. J. Simpson Got Away with Murder&lt;/em&gt; (Norton, 1996) and other books. Curt Gentry, an Edgar winner, is the author of &lt;em&gt;J. Edgar Hoover: The Man and the Secrets&lt;/em&gt; (available in Norton paperback) and &lt;em&gt;Frame-Up: The Incredible Case of Tom Mooney and Warren Billings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Engagingly written, Unholy Alliance is a comprehensive, popular history of the occult background and roots of the Nazi movement, showing how the ideas of a vast international network of late 19th- and early 20th-century occult groups influenced Nazi ideology. Levenda takes readers through the teachings of Madame Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley, the Thule Gesellschaft - the occult secret society that formed the ideological heart of the early Nazi Party - the Order of the Golden Dawn, and the Order of the Eastern Temple and demonstrates how each influenced Nazi ideology. He also details the expedition to Tibet of the Ancestral Heritage Research and Teaching Society, comprised of the same SS officers who would later be involved in grisly medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners. Levenda traces the Nazis' movements as they continued their activities after the war or morphed into neo-Nazi, skinhead, and satanic groups, such as the Christian Identity and White Aryan Resistance movements. Levenda's is not only a &amp;amp;quot;major work of investigative reporting,&amp;amp;quot; but also the striking story of the unholy alliance between politics and religion - or politics and occultism - that has dominated events in Europe and the Americas since World War I, with all its implications for continuing racial and religious violence in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.</description>

  <description>Romanul are forma unei largi confesiuni, fiind scris la persoana I, prin care personajul principal, Victor Petrini, îşi reconstituie existenta, încercând să-i afle sensul acesteia. A cunoscut mai multe experienţe erotice (Nineta, Căprioara, Matilda, Suzy) şi, din diferite motive, a eşuat in toate. A studiat filozofia şi, tânăr asistent, avea in fată o strălucită carieră universitară, ambiţionându-se să creeze o noua gnoză şi compunând un eseu despre Era ticăloşilor. S-a căsătorit cu Matilda (creând incertitudine in prietenia sa cu Petrică Nicolau, căruia aceasta ii era soţie) şi a avut cu ea o fetită, dar relaţia conjugală se desfăşoară sub semnul unei incompatibilităţi intre cei doi şi se degradează foarte repede. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Capodopera scriitorului în trei volume este centrată în jurul vieţii filosofului Victor Petrini, un fost deţinut politic care este obligat să cunoască mediile cele mai joase, mai umile, devenind, printre altele, chiar liderul unei echipe de deratizare.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Three ordinary women are about to take one extraordinary step....&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-two-year-old Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from Ole Miss. She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women--mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends--view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, &lt;em&gt;The Help&lt;/em&gt; is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jacket illustration Ellen Granter</description>

  <description>Lina is just like any other fifteen-year-old Lithuanian girl in 1941. She paints, she draws, she gets crushes on boys. Until one night when Soviet officers barge into her home, tearing her family from the comfortable life they've known. Separated from her father, forced onto a crowded and dirty train car, Lina, her mother, and her young brother slowly make their way north, crossing the Arctic Circle, to a work camp in the coldest reaches of Siberia. Here they are forced, under Stalin's orders, to dig for beets and fight for their lives under the cruelest of conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lina finds solace in her art, meticulously--and at great risk--documenting events by drawing, hoping these messages will make their way to her father's prison camp to let him know they are still alive. It is a long and harrowing journey, spanning years and covering 6,500 miles, but it is through incredible strength, love, and hope that Lina ultimately survives. &lt;em&gt;Between Shades of Gray&lt;/em&gt; is a novel that will steal your breath and capture your heart.</description>

  <description>Days before his release from prison, Shadow's wife, Laura, dies in a mysterious car crash. Numbly, he makes his way back home. On the plane, he encounters the enigmatic Mr Wednesday, who claims to be a refugee from a distant war, a former god and the king of America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together they embark on a profoundly strange journey across the heart of the USA, whilst all around them a storm of preternatural and epic proportions threatens to break.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scary, gripping and deeply unsettling, AMERICAN GODS takes a long, hard look into the soul of America. You'll be surprised by what and who it finds there...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the author's preferred text, never before published in the UK, and is about 12,000 words longer than the previous UK edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Coraline's often wondered what's behind the locked door in the drawing room. It reveals only a brick wall when she finally opens it, but when she tries again later, a passageway mysteriously appears. Coraline is surprised to find a flat decorated exactly like her own, but strangely different. And when she finds her "other" parents in this alternate world, they are much more interesting despite their creepy black button eyes. When they make it clear, however, that they want to make her theirs forever, Coraline begins a nightmarish game to rescue her real parents and three children imprisoned in a mirror. With only a bored-through stone and an aloof cat to help, Coraline confronts this harrowing task of escaping these monstrous creatures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gaiman has delivered a wonderfully chilling novel, subtle yet intense on many levels. The line between pleasant and horrible is often blurred until what's what becomes suddenly clear, and like Coraline, we resist leaving this strange world until we're hooked. Unnerving drawings also cast a dark shadow over the book's eerie atmosphere, which is only heightened by simple, hair-raising text. Coraline is otherworldly storytelling at its best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Donatien Alphonse François de Sade, conocido por su título de Marqués de Sade (París, 2 de junio de 1740 – Charenton-Saint-Maurice, Val-de-Marne, 2 de diciembre de 1814), fue un escritor francés, autor de Justine o los infortunios de la virtud, Historia de Aline y Valcour y otras numerosas novelas, cuentos y piezas de teatro. También le son atribuidas Los 120 días de Sodoma, La filosofía en el tocador, La nueva Justine y Juliette. En sus obras son característicos los antihéroes, protagonistas de las más aberrantes violaciones y de disertaciones en las que, mediante sofismas, justifican cínicamente sus actos.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Under Her Thumb: Erotic Stories of Female Domination&lt;/em&gt; will whet your appetite for all things Fem Dom. The book is a feast to be savored, whether your desires lean toward the bottom, the top, or you are simply curious. "Quiet" by Andrea Zanin will prepare you for all that is to come, and whether your interests lie in the loving submission of Lawrence Westerman’s "Her Majesty’s Plaything," boys wrestling for the opportunity to please their mistress in Laura Antoniou’s "Blame Spartacus" or the ultimate domination of Valerie Alexander’s "La Sexorcista," you will find what you’re looking for, and more - under her thumb. From a foreword by Midori to stories by greats like Rachel Kramer Bussel, D. L. King, Teresa Noelle Roberts, Dominic Santi and more, you won’t want to put the book down; but you’ll have to - from time to time.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Introducing one of the most famous characters in literature, Jean Valjean - the noble peasant imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread . In Les Misérables Victor Hugo takes readers deep into the Parisian underworld, immerses them in a battle between good and evil, and carries them onto the barricades during the uprising of 1832 with a breathtaking realism that is unsurpassed in modern prose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Thénardier and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds. Les Misérables gave Victor Hugo a canvas upon which he portrayed his criticism of the French political and judicial systems, but the portrait which resulted is larger than life, epic in scope - an extravagant spectacle that dazzles the senses even as it touches the heart.</description>

  <description>It's a fact of life: birds flock, fish school, people "tribe."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every company, indeed every organization, is a tribe, or if it's large enough, a network of tribes—groups of 20 to 150 people in which everyone knows everyone else, or at least knows of everyone else. Tribes are more powerful than teams, companies, or even CEOs, and yet their key leverage points have not been mapped—until now. In &lt;em&gt;Tribal Leadership&lt;/em&gt;, Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright show leaders how to assess their organization's tribal culture on a scale from one to five and then implement specific tools to elevate the stage to the next. The result is unprecedented success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a rigorous eight-year study of approximately 24,000 people in over two dozen corporations, Logan, King, and Fischer-Wright refine and define a common theme: the success of a company depends on its tribes, the strength of its tribes is determined by the tribal culture, and a thriving corporate culture can be established by an effective tribal leader. &lt;em&gt;Tribal Leadership&lt;/em&gt; will show leaders how to employ their companies' tribes to maximize productivity and profit: the authors' research, backed up with interviews ranging from Brian France (CEO of NASCAR) to "Dilbert" creator Scott Adams, shows that over three quarters of the organizations they've studied have tribal cultures that are merely adequate, no better than the third of five tribal stages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaders, managers, and organizations that fail to understand, motivate, and grow their tribes will find it impossible to succeed in an increasingly fragmented world of business. The often counterintuitive findings of &lt;em&gt;Tribal Leadership&lt;/em&gt; will help leaders at today's major corporations, small businesses, and nonprofits learn how to take the people in their organization from adequate to outstanding, to discover the secrets that have led the highest-level tribes (like the team at Apple that designed the iPod) to remarkable heights, and to find new ways to succeed where others have failed.</description>

  <description>I was never supposed to be a rock star. I had my life all planned out for me. Play football in college. Go to the NFL. Marry my high school sweetheart and live happily ever after. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I broke both our hearts that day when I told her I was leaving. I was young. I made the right decision for me, but the wrong decision for us. I’ve poured my soul into my music, but I’ve never forgotten her. Her smell, her smile. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now I’m going back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After ten years.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope I can explain that after all this time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I still want her to be my forever girl.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;There's a body in the water - and she's wearing your clothes...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Impulsive and intrepid psychotherapist, Juliet Grey, can’t resist responding to an anonymous text message telling her to go to Hammersmith Bridge at dawn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it isn’t simply the dead body in the water that disturbs her, it’s the way something uniquely personal to Juliet has been left on the corpse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another obscure message - another London bridge - and Juliet finds herself caught up with a serial killer, who leaves personal mementos instead of collecting trophies. Teaming up with local detective, DCI Brad Madison, Juliet strives to find out why she has been targeted and how it’s connected to the accident that killed her brother, nineteen years ago. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Juliet use her knowledge of the human psyche to get inside the mind of the killer, before another body is found under a bridge? And how long before Juliet herself becomes the next target?</description>

  <description>Madman, tyrant, animal - history has given Adolf Hitler many names. In Mein Kampf (My Struggle), often called the Nazi bible, Hitler describes his life, frustrations, ideals, and dreams. Born to an impoverished couple in a small town in Austria, the young Adolf grew up with the fervent desire to become a painter. The death of his parents and outright rejection from art schools in Vienna forced him into underpaid work as a labourer. During the First World War, Hitler served in the infantry and was decorated for bravery. After the war, he became actively involved with socialist political groups and quickly rose to power, establishing himself as Chairman of the National Socialist German Worker's party. In 1924, Hitler led a coalition of nationalist groups in a bid to overthrow the Bavarian government in Munich. The infamous Munich "Beer-hall putsch" was unsuccessful, and Hitler was arrested. During the nine months he was in prison, an embittered and frustrated Hitler dictated a personal manifesto to his loyal follower Rudolph Hess. He vented his sentiments against communism and the Jewish people in this document, which was to become Mein Kampf, the controversial book that is seen as the blue-print for Hitler's political and military campaign. In Mein Kampf, Hitler describes his strategy for rebuilding Germany and conquering Europe. It is a glimpse into the mind of a man who destabilized world peace and pursued the genocide now known as the Holocaust. "... I believe today that my conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator. In standing guard against the Jew I am defending the handiwork of the Lord"</description>

  <description>Nova Reed used to have dreams-of becoming a famous drummer, of marrying her true love. But all of that was taken away in an instant. Now she's getting by as best she can, though sometimes that means doing things the old Nova would never do. Things that are slowly eating away at her spirit. Every day blends into the next . . . until she meets Quinton Carter. His intense, honey brown eyes instantly draw her in, and he looks just about as broken as she feels inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quinton once got a second chance at life-but he doesn't want it. The tattoos on his chest are a constant reminder of what he's done, what he's lost. He's sworn to never allow happiness into his life . . . but then beautiful, sweet Nova makes him smile. He knows he's too damaged to get close to her, yet she's the only one who can make him feel alive again. Quinton will have to decide: does he deserve to start over? Or should he pay for his past forever?</description>

  <description>Between the pissed off creatures that want demon-hunter Lily Marks dead and the fallen angel who just...wants her, Lily is about ready to trade in forever for a comfy job in a cubicle farm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that she and Julian are civil to one another is enough to have her thrown out of the Sanctuary, but she can't shake her not-so-angelic stalker or how he brings her dangerously close to ecstasy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her forbidden relationship with Julian provides the perfect fuel for suspicion when a traitor is discovered to be working within the Sanctuary. Lily quickly finds herself hunted by well, everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her only hope is to discover the real traitor before she loses everything--and she'll need Julian's help. That is, if Julian is really there to help her...and not destroy her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, being a Nephilim isn't everything it's cracked up to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Oryx and Crake&lt;/strong&gt; is at once an unforgettable love story and a compelling vision of the future. Snowman, known as Jimmy before mankind was overwhelmed by a plague, is struggling to survive in a world where he may be the last human, and mourning the loss of his best friend, Crake, and the beautiful and elusive Oryx whom they both loved. In search of answers, Snowman embarks on a journey–with the help of the green-eyed Children of Crake–through the lush wilderness that was so recently a great city, until powerful corporations took mankind on an uncontrolled genetic engineering ride. Margaret Atwood projects us into a near future that is both all too familiar and beyond our imagining.</description>
