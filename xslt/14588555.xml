  <description>In &lt;em&gt;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&lt;/em&gt;, Milan Kundera tells the story of a young woman in love with a man torn between his love for her and his incorrigible womanizing and one of his mistresses and her humbly faithful lover. This magnificent novel juxtaposes geographically distant places; brilliant and playful reflections; and a variety of styles to take its place as perhaps the major achievement of one of the world’s truly great writers.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;Creativity is not a gift from the gods, says Twyla Tharp, bestowed by some divine and mystical spark. It is the product of preparation and effort, and it's within reach of everyone who wants to achieve it. All it takes is the willingness to make creativity a habit, an integral part of your life: &lt;em&gt;In order to be creative, you have to know how to prepare to be creative.&lt;/em&gt; In &lt;em&gt;The Creative Habit,&lt;/em&gt; Tharp takes the lessons she has learned in her remarkable thirty-five-year career and shares them with you, whatever creative impulses you follow -- whether you are a painter, composer, writer, director, choreographer, or, for that matter, a businessperson working on a deal, a chef developing a new dish, a mother wanting her child to see the world anew. &lt;p&gt; When Tharp is at a creative dead end, she relies on a lifetime of exercises to help her get out of the rut, and &lt;em&gt;The Creative Habit&lt;/em&gt; contains more than thirty of them to ease the fears of anyone facing a blank beginning and to open the mind to new possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tharp's exercises are practical and immediately doable -- for the novice or expert. In "Where's Your Pencil?" she reminds us to observe the world -- and get it down on paper. In "Coins and Chaos," she provides the simplest of mental games to restore order and peace. In "Do a Verb," she turns your mind and body into coworkers. In "Build a Bridge to the Next Day," she shows how to clean your cluttered mind overnight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To Tharp, sustained creativity begins with rituals, self-knowledge, harnessing your memories, and organizing your materials (so no insight is ever lost). Along the way she leads you by the hand through the painful first steps of scratching for ideas, finding the spine of your work, and getting out of ruts into productive grooves. In her creative realm, optimism rules. An empty room, a bare desk, a blank canvas can be energizing, not demoralizing. And in this inventive, encouraging book, Twyla Tharp shows us how to take a deep breath and begin!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Creativity isn t an occupation; it s a preoccupation. It is challenge for everyone in the modern world from business and advertising to education and beyond. Here, the world-famous advertising creative John Hegarty offers a pocket bible of creative thinking, aimed at provoking, challenging, and inspiring greater heights of innovation. From Renaissance art to rock n roll, Hegarty takes a wide-angle view of creativity as he sets out to demystify the many ups-and-downs that can arise during the creative process. Paralyzed by the blank page? Daunted by cynics in the workplace? Money leading you astray? Hegarty combines personal experience and anecdotes along with clear, pragmatic, and good-humored insight into tackling all creative challenges head on. Over fifty entries, including Good is the Enemy of Great, Respect Don t Revere, Get Angry, and Bad Weather relay useful and generous advice on how best to improve, sustain, and nurture creativity in any profession. Accompanied by copious irreverent line drawings from Hegarty s own sketchpad, Hegarty on Creativity is concise, accessible, and richly rewarding."</description>

  <description>We know that power is shifting: From West to East and North to South, from presidential palaces to public squares, from once formidable corporate behemoths to nimble startups and, slowly but surely, from men to women. But power is not merely shifting and dispersing. It is also decaying. Those in power today are more constrained in what they can do with it and more at risk of losing it than ever before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The End of Power&lt;/em&gt;, award-winning columnist and former &lt;em&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/em&gt; editor Moisés Naím illuminates the struggle between once-dominant megaplayers and the new micropowers challenging them in every field of human endeavor. Drawing on provocative, original research, Naím shows how the antiestablishment drive of micropowers can topple tyrants, dislodge monopolies, and open remarkable new opportunities, but it can also lead to chaos and paralysis. Naím deftly covers the seismic changes underway in business, religion, education, within families, and in all matters of war and peace. Examples abound in all walks of life: In 1977, eighty-nine countries were ruled by autocrats while today more than half the world’s population lives in democracies. CEO’s are more constrained and have shorter tenures than their predecessors. Modern tools of war, cheaper and more accessible, make it possible for groups like Hezbollah to afford their own drones. In the second half of 2010, the top ten hedge funds earned more than the world’s largest six banks combined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those in power retain it by erecting powerful barriers to keep challengers at bay. Today, insurgent forces dismantle those barriers more quickly and easily than ever, only to find that they themselves become vulnerable in the process. Accessible and captivating, Naím offers a revolutionary look at the inevitable end of power—and how it will change your world.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Ekhart Tolle's message is simple: living in the now is the truest path to happiness and enlightenment. And while this message may not seem stunningly original or fresh, Tolle's clear writing, supportive voice and enthusiasm make this an excellent manual for anyone who's ever wondered what exactly "living in the now" means. Foremost, Tolle is a world-class teacher, able to explain complicated concepts in concrete language. More importantly, within a chapter of reading this book, readers are already holding the world in a different container--more conscious of how thoughts and emotions get in the way of their ability to live in genuine peace and happiness.&lt;p&gt;Tolle packs a lot of information and inspirational ideas into &lt;em&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/em&gt;. (Topics include the source of Chi, enlightened relationships, creative use of the mind, impermanence and the cycle of life.) Thankfully, he's added markers that symbolise "break time". This is when readers should close the book and mull over what they just read. As a result, &lt;em&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/em&gt; reads like the highly acclaimed &lt;em&gt;A Course in Miracles&lt;/em&gt;--a spiritual guidebook that has the potential to inspire just as many study groups and change just as many lives for the better. --&lt;em&gt;Gail Hudson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>What are the grand dynamics that drive the accumulation and distribution of capital? Questions about the long-term evolution of inequality, the concentration of wealth, and the prospects for economic growth lie at the heart of political economy. But satisfactory answers have been hard to find for lack of adequate data and clear guiding theories. In Capital in the Twenty-First Century, "Thomas Piketty analyzes a unique collection of data from twenty countries, ranging as far back as the eighteenth century, to uncover key economic and social patterns. His findings will transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and inequality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Piketty shows that modern economic growth and the diffusion of knowledge have allowed us to avoid inequalities on the apocalyptic scale predicted by Karl Marx. But we have not modified the deep structures of capital and inequality as much as we thought in the optimistic decades following World War II. The main driver of inequality--the tendency of returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growth--today threatens to generate extreme inequalities that stir discontent and undermine democratic values. But economic trends are not acts of God. Political action has curbed dangerous inequalities in the past, Piketty says, and may do so again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A work of extraordinary ambition, originality, and rigor, Capital in the Twenty-First Century "reorients our understanding of economic history and confronts us with sobering lessons for today.</description>

  <description>WHAT IF YOU COULD BECOME WORLD-CLASS IN ANYTHING IN 6 MONTHS OR LESS?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 4-Hour Chef&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just a cookbook. It’s a choose-your-own-adventure guide to the world of rapid learning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author (and lifelong non-cook) Tim Ferriss takes you from Manhattan to Okinawa, and from Silicon Valley to Calcutta, unearthing the secrets of the world’s fastest learners and greatest chefs. Ferriss uses cooking to explain “meta-learning,” a step-by-step process that can be used to master anything, whether searing steak or shooting 3-pointers in basketball. That is the real “recipe” of &lt;em&gt;The 4-Hour Chef&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You'll train inside the kitchen for everything outside the kitchen. Featuring tips and tricks from chess prodigies, world-renowned chefs, pro athletes, master sommeliers, super models, and everyone in between, this “cookbook for people who don’t buy cookbooks” is a guide to mastering cooking and life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 4-Hour Chef&lt;/em&gt; is a five-stop journey through the art and science of learning:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. META-LEARNING. Before you learn to cook, you must learn to learn. META charts the path to doubling your learning potential.&lt;br&gt;2. THE DOMESTIC. DOM is where you learn the building blocks of cooking. These are the ABCs (techniques) that can take you from Dr, Seuss to Shakespeare.&lt;br&gt;3. THE WILD. Becoming a master student requires self-sufficiency in all things. WILD teaches you to hunt, forage, and survive.&lt;br&gt;4. THE SCIENTIST. SCI is the mad scientist and modernist painter wrapped into one. This is where you rediscover whimsy and wonder.&lt;br&gt;5. THE PROFESSIONAL. Swaraj, a term usually associated with Mahatma Gandhi, can be translated as “self-rule.” In PRO, we’ll look at how the best in the world become the best in the world, and how you can chart your own path far beyond this book.</description>

  <description>How much further should the affluent world push its material consumption? Does relative dematerialization lead to absolute decline in demand for materials? These and many other questions are discussed and answered in Making the Modern World: Materials and Dematerialization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of time, the modern world has become dependent on unprecedented flows of materials. Now even the most efficient production processes and the highest practical rates of recycling may not be enough to result in dematerialization rates that would be high enough to negate the rising demand for materials generated by continuing population growth and rising standards of living. This book explores the costs of this dependence and the potential for substantial dematerialization of modern economies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Making the Modern World: Materials and Dematerialization" considers the principal materials used throughout history, from wood and stone, through to metals, alloys, plastics and silicon, describing their extraction and production as well as their dominant applications. The evolving productivities of material extraction, processing, synthesis, finishing and distribution, and the energy costs and environmental impact of rising material consumption are examined in detail. The book concludes with an outlook for the future, discussing the prospects for dematerialization and potential constrains on materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This interdisciplinary text provides useful perspectives for readers with backgrounds including resource economics, environmental studies, energy analysis, mineral geology, industrial organization, manufacturing and material science.</description>

  <description>THE ROSIE PROJECT WAS COMPLETE BUT I WAS UNPREPARED FOR THE ROSIE EFFECT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GREETINGS. My name is Don Tillman. I am forty-one years old. I have been married to Rosie Jarman, world's most perfect woman, for ten months and ten days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marriage added significant complexity to my life. When we relocated to New York City, Rosie brought three maximum-size suitcases. We abandoned the Standardised Meal System and agreed that sex should not be scheduled in advance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Rosie told me we had 'something to celebrate', and I was faced with a challenge even greater than finding a partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have attempted to follow traditional protocols and have sourced advice from all six of my friends, plus a therapist and the internet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The result has been a web of deceit. I am now in danger of prosecution, deportation and professional disgrace. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And of losing Rosie forever.</description>

  <description>In the 1980s and 1990s many in the West came to believe in the myth of an East-Asian economic miracle. Japan was going to dominate, then China. Countries were called “tigers” or “mini-dragons,” and were seen as not just development prodigies, but as a unified bloc, culturally and economically similar, and inexorably on the rise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Studwell has spent two decades as a reporter in the region, and The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; said he “should be named chief myth-buster for Asian business.” In &lt;em&gt;How Asia Works&lt;/em&gt;, Studwell distills his extensive research into the economies of nine countries—Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and China—into an accessible, readable narrative that debunks Western misconceptions, shows what really happened in Asia and why, and for once makes clear why some countries have boomed while others have languished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Studwell’s in-depth analysis focuses on three main areas: land policy, manufacturing, and finance. Land reform has been essential to the success of Asian economies, giving a kick start to development by utilizing a large workforce and providing capital for growth. With manufacturing, industrial development alone is not sufficient, Studwell argues. Instead, countries need “export discipline,” a government that forces companies to compete on the global scale. And in finance, effective regulation is essential for fostering, and sustaining growth. To explore all of these subjects, Studwell journeys far and wide, drawing on fascinating examples from a Philippine sugar baron’s stifling of reform to the explosive growth at a Korean steel mill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thoroughly researched and impressive in scope, &lt;em&gt;How Asia Works&lt;/em&gt; is essential reading for anyone interested in the development of these dynamic countries, a region that will shape the future of the world. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>"Like Henry David Thoreau, but with Wi-Fi." -Boston Globe What if everything you ever wanted isn't what you actually want? Twenty-something, suit-clad, and upwardly mobile, Joshua Fields Millburn thought he had everything anyone could ever want. Until he didn't anymore. Blindsided by the loss of his mother and his marriage in the same month, Millburn started questioning every aspect of the life he had built for himself. Then, he accidentally discovered a lifestyle known as minimalism...and everything started to change. That was four years ago. Since, Millburn, now 32, has embraced simplicity. In the pursuit of looking for something more substantial than compulsory consumption and the broken American Dream, he jettisoned most of his material possessions, paid off loads of crippling debt, and walked away from his six-figure career. So, when everything was gone, what was left? Not a how-to book but a why-to book, Everything That Remains is the touching, surprising story of what happened when one young man decided to let go of everything and begin living more deliberately. Heartrending, uplifting, and deeply personal, this engrossing memoir is peppered with insightful (and often hilarious) interruptions by Ryan Nicodemus, Millburn's best friend of twenty years.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The first full-length translation in English of an essential work of postmodernism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The publication of &lt;em&gt;Simulacra et Simulation&lt;/em&gt; in 1981 marked Jean Baudrillard's first important step toward theorizing the postmodern. Moving away from the Marxist/Freudian approaches that had concerned him earlier, Baudrillard developed in this book a theory of contemporary culture that relies on displacing economic notions of cultural production with notions of cultural expenditure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Baudrillard uses the concepts of the simulacra—the copy without an original—and simulation. These terms are crucial to an understanding of the postmodern, to the extent that they address the concept of mass reproduction and reproduceability that characterizes our electronic media culture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Baudrillard's book represents a unique and original effort to rethink cultural theory from the perspective of a new concept of cultural materialism, one that radically redefines postmodern formulations of the body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheila Glaser&lt;/strong&gt; is an editor at &lt;em&gt;Artforum magazine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Are you and your spouse speaking the same language? While love is a many splendored thing, it is sometimes a very confusing thing, too. And as people come in all varieties, shapes, and sizes, so do their choices of personal expressions of love. But more often than not, the giver and the receiver express love in two different ways. This can lead to misunderstanding, quarrels, and even divorce.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, and physical touch are the five basic love languages. Dr. Gary Chapman identifies these and guides couples towards a better understanding of their unique languages of love. Learn to speak and understand your mate's love language, and in no time you will be able to effectively love and truly feel loved in return. Skillful communication is within your grasp!</description>

  <description>How does the situation we’re in influence the way we behave and think? Professors Ross and Nisbett eloquently argue that the context we find ourselves in substantially affects our behavior.&lt;br&gt;With a new foreword by Malcolm Gladwell, and a new afterword by the authors, this timely reissue of one of social psychology’s classic texts is essential reading for anyone with an interest in human behavior.&lt;br&gt; “All of my books have been, in some sense, intellectual godchildren of The Person and the Situation. This book has been a constant companion over the past 10 years.”Malcolm Gladwell, in his new foreword</description>

  <description>Few books on software project management have been as influential and timeless as The Mythical Man-Month. With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking  opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time.&lt;p&gt;The added chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions asserted in the original book, including Brooks' central argument in The Mythical Man-Month: that large programming projects suffer management problems different from small ones due to the division of labor; that the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that it is difficult but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks' view of these propositions a generation later; (3) a reprint of his classic 1986 paper "No Silver Bullet";  and (4) today's thoughts on the 1986 assertion, "There will be no silver bullet within ten years."&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Lean In--Sheryl Sandberg's provocative, inspiring book about women and power--grew out of an electrifying TED talk Sandberg gave in 2010, in which she expressed her concern that progress for women in achieving major leadership positions had stalled. The talk became a phenomenon and has since been viewed nearly two million times. In Lean In, she fuses humorous personal anecdotes, singular lessons on confidence and leadership, and practical advice for women based on research, data, her own experiences, and the experiences of other women of all ages. Sandberg has an uncanny gift for cutting through layers of ambiguity that surround working women, and in Lean In she grapples, piercingly, with the great questions of modern life. Her message to women is overwhelmingly positive. She is a trailblazing model for the ideas she so passionately espouses, and she's on the pulse of a topic that has never been more relevant.</description>

  <description>Do the Work&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our enemy is not lack of preparation; it's not the difficulty of the project, or the state of the marketplace or the emptiness of our bank account.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The enemy is resistance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The enemy is our chattering brain, which, if we give it so much as a nanosecond, will start producing excuses, alibis, transparent self-justifications and a million reasons why he can't/shouldn't/won't do what we know we need to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Start before you're ready.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Zero to One&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zero to One&lt;/em&gt; presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.</description>

  <description>Written with full cooperation from top management, including cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, this is the inside story behind Google, the most successful and most admired technology company of our time, told by one of our best technology writers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Few companies in history have ever been as successful and as admired as Google, the company that has transformed the Internet and become an indispensable part of our lives. How has Google done it? Veteran technology reporter Steven Levy was granted unprecedented access to the company, and in this revelatory book he takes readers inside Google headquarters&amp;amp;#8212;the Googleplex&amp;amp;#8212;to show how Google works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; While they were still students at Stanford, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revolutionized Internet search. They followed this brilliant innovation with another, as two of Google&amp;amp;#8217;s earliest employees found a way to do what no one else had: make billions of dollars from Internet advertising. With this cash cow, Google was able to expand dramatically and take on other transformative projects: more efficient data centers, open-source cell phones, free Internet video (YouTube), cloud computing, digitizing books, and much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The key to Google&amp;amp;#8217;s success in all these businesses, Levy reveals, is its engineering mind-set and adoption of such Internet values as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. After its unapologetically elitist approach to hiring, Google pampers its engineers&amp;amp;#8212;free food and dry cleaning, on-site doctors and masseuses&amp;amp;#8212;and gives them all the resources they need to succeed. Even today, with a workforce of more than 23,000, Larry Page signs off on every hire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But has Google lost its innovative edge? With its newest initiative, social networking, Google is chasing a successful competitor for the first time. Some employees are leaving the company for smaller, nimbler start-ups. Can the company that famously decided not to be evil still compete?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; No other book has ever turned Google inside out as Levy does with &lt;em&gt;In the Plex&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

Many young people want to work for themselves. Corporates with their cash reserves will be the new venture capitalists. This book explains how society is re-organising itself.</description>

  <description>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</description>

  <description>For everyone interested in starting a record label-to market new talent or to release and promote their own music-there has never been a better time to do it! &lt;br&gt;Music can be released, distributed, and promoted for a fraction of traditional costs. Veteran author and music-business consultant Daylle Deanna Schwartz (who started and ran her own label) has rewritten and expanded her classic, "Start &amp;amp; Run Your Own Record Label," to reflect industry changes and new opportunities for marketing music in today's climate. &lt;br&gt;"Start &amp;amp; Run Your Own Record Label" is a comprehensive guidebook to building a record label, packed with how-to information about market trends and revenue streams for music releases. In addition to updated information on physical distribution, generating publicity, marketing, and promotion, it also has new information about key issues including: &lt;br&gt;-Balancing on and offline promotion and marketing&lt;br&gt;-Making the most of online resources (social-networking sites, blogs, ringtones, videos, radio, and more)&lt;br&gt;-Using digital distribution profitably&lt;br&gt;-Licensing your recordings for use in the media &lt;br&gt;-Marketing music overseas &lt;br&gt;Ms. Schwartz has compiled new interviews with top industry professionals and independent labels-including recording artist CJ Baran (Push Play), Jed Carlson (founder, ReverbNation), Daniel Glass (founder, Glassnote Entertainment), blogger Perez Hilton, Scott Lapatine (founder, Stereogum), recording artist Ingrid Michaelson, Jeff Price (founder, Tunecore), MP3 bloggers, music-magazine editors, publicists, and others-for the most up-to-date, authoritative, and practical compendium available.

  <description>A lot of people talk about how great it is to start a business, but only Ben Horowitz is brutally honest about how hard it is to run one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Hard Thing About Hard Things&lt;/em&gt;, Ben Horowitz, cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz and one of Silicon Valley's most respected and experienced entrepreneurs, draws on his own story of founding, running, selling, buying, managing, and investing in technology companies to offer essential advice and practical wisdom for navigating the toughest problems business schools don't cover. His blog has garnered a devoted following of millions of readers who have come to rely on him to help them run their businesses. A lifelong rap fan, Horowitz amplifies business lessons with lyrics from his favorite songs and tells it straight about everything from firing friends to poaching competitors, from cultivating and sustaining a CEO mentality to knowing the right time to cash in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His advice is grounded in anecdotes from his own hard-earned rise—from cofounding the early cloud service provider Loudcloud to building the phenomenally successful Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, both with fellow tech superstar Marc Andreessen (inventor of Mosaic, the Internet's first popular Web browser). This is no polished victory lap; he analyzes issues with no easy answers through his trials, including&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;demoting (or firing) a loyal friend;&lt;br&gt;whether you should incorporate titles and promotions, and how to handle them;&lt;br&gt;if it's OK to hire people from your friend's company;&lt;br&gt;how to manage your own psychology, while the whole company is relying on you;&lt;br&gt;what to do when smart people are bad employees;&lt;br&gt;why Andreessen Horowitz prefers founder CEOs, and how to become one;&lt;br&gt;whether you should sell your company, and how to do it.&lt;br&gt;Filled with Horowitz's trademark humor and straight talk, and drawing from his personal and often humbling experiences, &lt;em&gt;The Hard Thing About Hard Things&lt;/em&gt; is invaluable for veteran entrepreneurs as well as those aspiring to their own new ventures.</description>

  <description>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled "quiet," it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Gogh’s sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, &lt;em&gt;Quiet &lt;/em&gt;shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the reader on a journey from Dale Carnegie’s birthplace to Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the twentieth century and explores its far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of American business culture, where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation, and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and introverts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps most inspiring, she introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Finally, she offers invaluable advice on everything from how to better negotiate differences in introvert-extrovert relationships to how to empower an introverted child to when it makes sense to be a "pretend extrovert."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This extraordinary book has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how introverts see themselves.</description>

  <description>A New York Times bestseller &lt;br&gt;Superintelligence asks the questions: What happens when machines surpass humans in general intelligence? Will artificial agents save or destroy us? Nick Bostrom lays the foundation for understanding the future of humanity and intelligent life. &lt;br&gt;The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. If machine brains surpassed human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become extremely powerful - possibly beyond our control. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on humans than on the species itself, so would the fate of humankind depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence. &lt;br&gt;But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed Artificial Intelligence, to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation? &lt;br&gt;This profoundly ambitious and original book breaks down a vast track of difficult intellectual terrain. After an utterly engrossing journey that takes us to the frontiers of thinking about the human condition and the future of intelligent life, we find in Nick Bostrom's work nothing less than a reconceptualization of the essential task of our time.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;More uncommon common sense from the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Art of the Start&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In Silicon Valley slang, a “bozo explosion” is what causes a lean, mean, fighting machine of a company to slide into mediocrity. As Guy Kawasaki puts it, “If the two most popular words in your company are &lt;em&gt;partner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;strategic&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;partner&lt;/em&gt; has become a verb, and &lt;em&gt;strategic&lt;/em&gt; is used to describe decisions and activities that don’t make sense” . . . it’s time for a reality check.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For nearly three decades, Kawasaki has earned a stellar reputation as an entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and irreverent pundit. His 2004 bestseller, &lt;em&gt;The Art of the Start&lt;/em&gt;, has become the most acclaimed bible for small business. And his blog is consistently one of the fifty most popular in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Now, Kawasaki has compiled his best wit, wisdom, and contrarian opinions in handy book form. From competition to customer service, innovation to marketing, he shows readers how to ignore fads and foolishness while sticking to commonsense practices. He explains, for instance:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • How to get a standing ovation&lt;br&gt; • The art of schmoozing&lt;br&gt; • How to create a community&lt;br&gt; • The top ten lies of entrepreneurs&lt;br&gt; • Everything you wanted to know about getting a job in Silicon Valley but didn’t know who to ask&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Provocative, useful, and very funny, this “no bull shiitake” book will show you why readers around the world love Guy Kawasaki.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>From the best-selling author of &lt;em&gt;The Elegant Universe&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Fabric of the Cosmos&lt;/em&gt; comes his most expansive and accessible book to date—a book that takes on the grandest question: Is ours the only universe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a time when “universe” meant all there is. Everything. Yet, in recent years discoveries in physics and cosmology have led a number of scientists to conclude that our universe may be one among many. With crystal-clear prose and inspired use of analogy, Brian Greene shows how a range of different “multiverse” proposals emerges from theories developed to explain the most refined observations of both subatomic particles and the dark depths of space: a multiverse in which you have an infinite number of doppelgängers, each reading this sentence in a distant universe; a multiverse comprising a vast ocean of bubble universes, of which ours is but one; a multiverse that endlessly cycles through time, or one that might be hovering millimeters away yet remains invisible; another in which every possibility allowed by quantum physics is brought to life. Or, perhaps strangest of all, a multiverse made purely of math.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greene, one of our foremost physicists and science writers, takes us on a captivating exploration of these parallel worlds and reveals how much of reality’s true nature may be deeply hidden within them. And, with his unrivaled ability to make the most challenging of material accessible and entertaining, Greene tackles the core question: How can fundamental science progress if great swaths of reality lie beyond our reach?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sparked by Greene’s trademark wit and precision, &lt;em&gt;The Hidden Reality&lt;/em&gt; is at once a far-reaching survey of cutting-edge physics and a remarkable journey to the very edge of reality—a journey grounded firmly in science and limited only by our imagination.</description>

  <description>If you reward your children for doing their homework, they will usually respond by getting it done. But is this the most effective method of motivation? No, says psychologist Edward L. Deci, who challenges traditional thinking and shows that this method actually works &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; performance. The best way to motivate people—at school, at work, or at home—is to support their sense of autonomy. Explaining the reasons why a task is important and then allowing as much personal freedom as possible in carrying out the task will stimulate interest and commitment, and is a much more effective approach than the standard system of reward and punishment. We are all inherently interested in the world, argues Deci, so why not nurture that interest in each other? Instead of asking, "How can I motivate people?" we should be asking, "How can I create the conditions within which people will motivate themselves?""An insightful and provocative meditation on how people can become more genuinely engaged and succesful in pursuing their goals." —&lt;strong&gt;Publisher's Weekly&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Mindset&lt;/em&gt; is one of those rare books that can help you make positive changes in your life and at the same time see the world in a new way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A leading expert in motivation and personality psychology, Carol Dweck has discovered in more than twenty years of research that our mindset is not a minor personality quirk: it creates our whole mental world. It explains how we become optimistic or pessimistic. It shapes our goals, our attitude toward work and relationships, and how we raise our kids, ultimately predicting whether or not we will fulfill our potential. Dweck has found that everyone has one of two basic mindsets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have the fixed mindset, you believe that your talents and abilities are set in stone–either you have them or you don’t. You must prove yourself over and over, trying to look smart and talented at all costs. This is the path of stagnation. If you have a growth mindset, however, you know that talents can be developed and that great abilities are built over time. This is the path of opportunity–and success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dweck demonstrates that mindset unfolds in childhood and adulthood and drives every aspect of our lives, from work to sports, from relationships to parenting. She reveals how creative geniuses in all fields–music, literature, science, sports, business–apply the growth mindset to achieve results. Perhaps even more important, she shows us how we can change our mindset at any stage of life to achieve true success and fulfillment. She looks across a broad range of &lt;br&gt;applications and helps parents, teachers, coaches, and executives see how they can promote the growth mindset. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Highly engaging and very practical, &lt;em&gt;Mindset&lt;/em&gt; breaks new ground as it leads you to change how you feel about yourself and your future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This book is an essential read for parents, teachers, coaches, and others who are instrumental in determining a child’s mind-set, and in turn, his or her future success, as well as for those who would like to increase their own feelings of success and fulfillment.” --Library Journal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contents&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Introduction&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Mindsets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why Do People Differ?&lt;br&gt;What Does All This Mean for You? The Two Mindsets&lt;br&gt;A View from the Two Mindsets&lt;br&gt;So, What’s New?&lt;br&gt;Self-Insight: Who Has Accurate Views of Their Assets and Limitations?&lt;br&gt;What’s iIn Store&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.

  <description>More than one million hardcovers sold&lt;br&gt;Now available for the first time in paperback!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Classic Text Annotated to Update Graham's Timeless Wisdom for Today's Market Conditions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The greatest investment advisor of the twentieth century, Benjamin Graham taught and inspired people worldwide. Graham's philosophy of "value investing" -- which shields investors from substantial error and teaches them to develop long-term strategies -- has made &lt;em&gt;The Intelligent Investor&lt;/em&gt; the stock market bible ever since its original publication in 1949.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the years, market developments have proven the wisdom of Graham's strategies. While preserving the integrity of Graham's original text, this revised edition includes updated commentary by noted financial journalist Jason Zweig, whose perspective incorporates the realities of today's market, draws parallels between Graham's examples and today's financial headlines, and gives readers a more thorough understanding of how to apply Graham's principles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vital and indispensable, this HarperBusiness Essentials edition of &lt;em&gt;The Intelligent Investor&lt;/em&gt; is the most important book you will ever read on how to reach your financial goals.</description>

  <description>The world's foremost producer of personal development and motivational audio programs gives you the tools to unleash the secret of peak performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember the last time that you were so focused, so motivated that you felt at the absolute top of your form -- alert, energized and free of self-consciousness? Chances are you were experiencing flow -- an almost euphoric state of concentration and complete involvement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, esteemed psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi reveals how you can achieve this state of mind at will -- and turn everyday experience into a moment by moment opportunity for joy and self-fulfillment. Drawing on over 30 years of breakthrough research into what makes people satisfied, he explains the key elements of the flow experience</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Expanding on a landmark cover story in &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, a top journalist debunks the myths of exceptional performance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; One of the most popular &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; articles in many years was a cover story called ?What It Takes to Be Great.? Geoff Colvin offered new evidence that top performers in any field--from Tiger Woods and Winston Churchill to Warren Buffett and Jack Welch--are not determined by their inborn talents. Greatness doesn?t come from DNA but from practice and perseverance honed over decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; And not just plain old hard work, like your grandmother might have advocated, but a very specific kind of work. The key is how you practice, how you analyze the results of your progress and learn from your mistakes, that enables you to achieve greatness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Now Colvin has expanded his article with much more scientific background and real-world examples. He shows that the skills of business?negotiating deals, evaluating financial statements, and all the rest?obey the principles that lead to greatness, so that anyone can get better at them with the right kind of effort. Even the hardest decisions and interactions can be systematically improved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This new mind-set, combined with Colvin?s practical advice, will change the way you think about your job and career?and will inspire you to achieve more in all you do.</description>

  <description>Is there a method to our madness when it comes to shopping? Hailed by the San Francisco Chronicle as "a Sherlock Holmes for retailers," author and research company CEO Paco Underhill answers with a definitive "yes" in this witty, eye-opening report on our ever-evolving consumer culture. Why We Buy is based on hard data gleaned from thousands of hours of field research–in shopping malls, department stores, and supermarkets across America. With his team of sleuths tracking our every move, Paco Underhill lays bare the struggle among merchants, marketers, and increasingly knowledgeable consumers for control.</description>

In CRUSH IT! Why NOW Is The Time To Cash In On Your Passion, Gary Vaynerchuk shows you how to use the power of the Internet to turn your real interests into real businesses. Gary spent years building his family business from a local wine shop into a national industry leader. Then one day he turned on a video camera, and by using the secrets revealed in this book, transformed his entire life and earning potential by building his personal brand. By the end of this book, any reader will have learned how to harness the power of the Internet to make their entrepreneurial dreams come true. Step by step, CRUSH IT! is the ultimate driver′s manual for modern business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gary Vaynerchuk has captured attention with his pioneering, multi-faceted approach to personal branding and business. After primarily utilizing traditional advertising techniques to build his family′s local retail wine business into a national industry leader, Gary rapidly leveraged social media tools such as Twitter and Facebook to promote Wine Library TV, &lt;a href="http://tv.winelibrary.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://tv.winelibrary.com&lt;/a&gt;, his video blog about wine. Gary has always had an early-to-market approach, launching Wine Library′s retail website in 1997 and Wine Library TV in February of 2006. His lessons on social media, passion, transparency, and reactionary business are not to be missed!</description>

  <description>The acclaimed Wall Street Journal and Business Week Bestseller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You're either a Purple Cow or you're not. You're either remarkable or invisible. Make your choice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do Starbucks and JetBlue and KrispyKreme and Apple and DutchBoy and Kensington and Zespri and Hard Candy have that you don't? How do they continue to confound critics and achieve spectacular growth, leaving behind former tried-and true brands to gasp their last? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Face it, the checklist of tired 'P's marketers have used for decades to get their product noticed - Pricing, Promotion, Publicity, to name a few - aren't working anymore. There's an exceptionally important 'P' that has to be added to the list. It's Purple Cow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cows, after you've seen one, or two, or ten, are boring. A Purple Cow, though...now that would be something. Purple Cow describes something phenomenal, something counterintuitive and exciting and flat out unbelievable. Every day, consumers come face to face with a lot of boring stuff-a lot of brown cows - but you can bet they won't forget a Purple Cow. And it's not a marketing function that you can slap on to your product or service. Purple Cow is inherent. It's built right in, or it's not there. Period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Purple Cow, Seth Godin urges you to put a Purple Cow into everything you build, and everything you do, to create something truly noticeable. It's a manifesto for marketers who want to help create products that are worth marketing in the first place. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Description from Amazon.com</description>

  <description>Mark Twain once observed, “A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.” His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus public-health scares circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas–business people, teachers, politicians, journalists, and others–struggle to make their ideas “stick.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why do some ideas thrive while others die? And how do we improve the chances of worthy ideas? In &lt;em&gt;Made to Stick&lt;/em&gt;, accomplished educators and idea collectors Chip and Dan Heath tackle head-on these vexing questions. Inside, the brothers Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the “human scale principle,” using the “Velcro Theory of Memory,” and creating “curiosity gaps.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this indispensable guide, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds–from the infamous “kidney theft ring” hoax to a coach’s lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony–draw their power from the same six traits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Made to Stick &lt;/em&gt;is a book that will transform the way you communicate ideas. It’s a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures)–the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of “the Mother Teresa Effect”; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice. Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, &lt;em&gt;Made to Stick&lt;/em&gt; shows us the vital principles of winning ideas–and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt; The new question: Ten years after the worldwide bestseller "Good to Great," Jim Collins returns to ask: Why do some companies thrive in uncertainty, even chaos, and others do not? In "Great by Choice," Collins and his colleague, Morten T. Hansen, enumerate the principles for building a truly great enterprise in unpredictable, tumultuous, and fast-moving times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new study: "Great by Choice" distinguishes itself from Collins's prior work by its focus on the type of unstable environments faced by leaders today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new findings: The best leaders were more disciplined, more empirical, and more paranoid. Following the belief that leading in a "fast world" always requires "fast decisions" and "fast action" is a good way to get killed. The great companies changed less in reaction to a radically changing world than the comparison companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This book is classic Collins: contrarian, data-driven, and uplifting. He and Hansen show convincingly that, even in a chaotic and uncertain world, greatness happens by choice, not by chance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The Challenge&lt;br&gt;Built to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the verybeginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Study&lt;br&gt;For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Standards&lt;br&gt;Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Comparisons&lt;br&gt;The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness — why some companies make the leap and others don't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Findings&lt;br&gt;The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness.&lt;br&gt;The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence.&lt;br&gt;A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology.&lt;br&gt;The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.&lt;br&gt;“Some of the key concepts discerned in the study,” comments Jim Collins, "fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Some of the key concepts discerned in the study," comments Jim Collins, "fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?</description>

  <description>Los auténticos líderes no se distinguen por su talento innato o su dominio técnico, sino por su capacidad de inspirar en otros energía, pasión y entusiasmo. Y estos sentimientos se extienden rápidamente en los equipos de trabajo, estimulando a los demás. Una parte fundamental del liderazgo efectivo es saber controlar y usar adecuadamente las propias emociones, y potenciar sentimientos positivos en los equipos, es decir, crear resonancia. Sin tener en cuenta las emociones, no puede obtenerse lo mejor de las personas y conseguir que las organizaciones prosperen. A partir del análisis del estilo de liderazgo de casi 4.000 directivos de todo tipo de organizaciones y del contacto directo con muchos de ellos, Daniel Goleman, Richard Boyatzis y Annie McKee demuestran que la resonancia del líder es un factor imprescindible para su éxito y, más aún, que esta resonancia se puede aprender. Con numerosos consejos prácticos e incontables ejemplos, el libro permitirá, tanto a jóvenes profesionales como a otros ejecutivos, reconocer los estilos de liderazgo, identificar y mejorar estas competencias críticas en uno mismo, conducir a los demás a hacerlo, y liderar la resonancia no solamente en el trabajo sino en todos los aspectos de nuestra vida.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable.  The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eric Ries defines a startup as &lt;strong&gt;an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively.  Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning,” rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, &lt;em&gt;The Lean Startup&lt;/em&gt; offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it’s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A new product, a new service, a new company, a new division, a new organization, a new anything—where there’s a will, here’s the way.&lt;/strong&gt; It begins with a dream that just won’t quit, the once-in-a-lifetime thunderbolt of pure inspiration, the obsession, the world-beater, the killer app, the next big thing. Everyone who wants to make the world a better place becomes possessed by a grand idea.&lt;br&gt;But what does it take to turn your idea into action?  Whether you are an entrepreneur, intrapreneur, or not-for-profit crusader, there’s no shortage of advice available on issues such as writing a business plan, recruiting, raising capital, and branding. In fact, there are so many books, articles, and Web sites that many startups get bogged down to the point of paralysis. Or else they focus on the wrong priorities and go broke before they discover their mistakes. In &lt;em&gt;The Art of the Start,&lt;/em&gt; Guy Kawasaki brings two decades of experience as one of business’s most original and irreverent strategists to offer the essential guide for anyone starting anything, from a multinational corporation to a church group. At Apple in the 1980s, he helped lead one of the great companies of the century, turning ordinary consumers into evangelists. As founder and CEO of Garage Technology Ventures, a venture capital firm, he has field-tested his ideas with dozens of newly hatched companies. And as the author of bestselling business books and articles, he has advised thousands of people who are making their startup dreams real. From raising money to hiring the right people, from defining your positioning to creating a brand, from creating buzz to buzzing the competition, from managing a board to fostering a community, this book will guide you through an adventure that’s more art than science—the art of the start.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In this revolutionary bestseller, Harvard professor Clayton M. Christensen says outstanding companies can do everything right and still lose their market leadership -- or worse, disappear completely. And he not only proves what he says, he tells others how to avoid a similar fate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Focusing on "disruptive technology" -- the Honda Super Cub, Intel's 8088 processor, or the hydraulic excavator, for example -- Christensen shows why most companies miss "the next great wave." Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies, "The Innovator's Dilemma" presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out: When it is right "not" to listen to customers. When to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise lower margins. When to pursue small markets at the expense of seemingly larger and more lucrative ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharp, cogent, and provocative, "The Innovator's Dilemma" is one of the most talked-about books of our time -- and one no savvy manager or entrepreneur should be without.</description>

  <description>Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945, Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering, but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory--known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos ("meaning")--holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, &lt;em&gt;Man's Search for Meaning&lt;/em&gt; had sold more than 10 million copies in twenty-four languages. A 1991 reader survey for the Library of Congress that asked readers to name a "book that made a difference in your life" found &lt;em&gt;Man's Search for Meaning&lt;/em&gt; among the ten most influential books in America.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The highly anticipated follow-up to Simon Sinek’s global bestseller &lt;em&gt;Start with Why&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Simon Sinek is an optimist, a visionary thinker, and a leader of the cultural revolution of WHY. His second book is the natural extension of &lt;em&gt;Start with Why&lt;/em&gt;, expanding his ideas at the organizational level. Determining a company’s WHY is crucial, but only the beginning. The next step is how do you get people on board with your WHY? How do you inspire deep trust and commitment to the company and one another? He cites the Marine Corps for having found a way to build a culture in which men and women are willing to risk their lives, because they know others would do the same for them. It’s not brainwashing; it’s actually based on the biology of how and when people are naturally at their best. If businesses could adopt this supportive mentality, employees would be more motivated to take bigger risks, because they’d know their colleagues and company would back them up, no matter what. Drawing on powerful and inspiring stories, Sinek shows how to sustain an organization’s WHY while continually adding people to the mix.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Available for the first time in the United States, this international bestseller reveals the secrets of nonverbal communication to give you confidence and control in any face-to-face encounter–from making a great first impression and acing a job interview to finding the right partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a scientific fact that people’s gestures give away their true intentions. Yet most of us don’t know how to read body language–and don’t realize how our own physical movements speak to others. Now the world’s foremost experts on the subject share their techniques for reading body language signals to achieve success in every area of life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing upon more than thirty years in the field, as well as cutting-edge research from evolutionary biology, psychology, and medical technologies that demonstrate what happens in the brain, the authors examine each component of body language and give you the basic vocabulary to read attitudes and emotions through behavior. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discover:&lt;br&gt;• How palms and handshakes are used to gain control&lt;br&gt;• The most common gestures of liars&lt;br&gt;• How the legs reveal what the mind wants to do&lt;br&gt;• The most common male and female courtship gestures and signals&lt;br&gt;• The secret signals of cigarettes, glasses, and makeup&lt;br&gt;• The magic of smiles–including smiling advice for women&lt;br&gt;• How to use nonverbal cues and signals to communicate more effectively and get the reactions you want&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filled with fascinating insights, humorous observations, and simple strategies that you can apply to any situation, this intriguing book will enrich your communication with and understanding of others–as well as yourself.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Think and Grow Rich&lt;/strong&gt; has been called the "Granddaddy of All Motivational Literature." It was the first book to boldly ask, "What makes a winner?" The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top ranks of the world's winners himself.The most famous of all teachers of success spent "a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort" to produce the "Law of Success" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in this one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the original &lt;strong&gt;Think and Grow Rich&lt;/strong&gt;, published in 1937, Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. In the updated version, Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth. Outmoded or arcane terminology and examples are faithfully refreshed to preclude any stumbling blocks to a new generation of readers.</description>

  <description>E-Myth \ 'e-,'mith\ n 1: the entrepreneurial myth: the myth that most people who start small businesses are entrepreneurs 2: the fatal assumption that an individual who understands the technical work of a business can successfully run a business that does that technical work&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Voted #1 business book by &lt;em&gt;Inc.&lt;/em&gt; 500 CEOs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An instant classic, this revised and updated edition of the phenomenal bestseller dispels the myths about starting your own business. Small business consultant and author Michael E. Gerber, with sharp insight gained from years of experience, points out how common assumptions, expectations, and even technical expertise can get in the way of running a successful business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gerber walks you through the steps in the life of a business—from entrepreneurial infancy through adolescent growing pains to the mature entrepreneurial perspective: the guiding light of all businesses that succeed—and shows how to apply the lessons of franchising to any business, whether or not it is a franchise. Most importantly, Gerber draws the vital, often overlooked distinction between working &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; your business and working &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; your business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The E-Myth Revisited&lt;/em&gt; will help you grow your business in a productive, assured way.</description>

  <description>In his #1 bestselling books &lt;em&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Outliers&lt;/em&gt;, Malcolm Gladwell has explored the ways we understand and change our world. Now he looks at the complex and surprising ways the weak can defeat the strong, the small can match up against the giant, and how our goals (often culturally determined) can make a huge difference in our ultimate sense of success. Drawing upon examples from the world of business, sports, culture, cutting-edge psychology, and an array of unforgettable characters around the world, &lt;em&gt;David and Goliath&lt;/em&gt; is in many ways the most practical and provocative book Malcolm Gladwell has ever written.</description>

  <description>In his landmark bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/em&gt;, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt;, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt; is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt; we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of "blink": the election of Warren Harding; "New Coke"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt; reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of "thin-slicing"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introduction: The statue that didn´t look right&lt;br&gt;1. The Theory of Thin Slices: How a little bit of knowledge goes a long way&lt;br&gt;2. The Locked Door: The secret life of snap decisions&lt;br&gt;3.

Seven Seconds in the Bronx: The delicate art of mind reading&lt;br&gt;Conclusion: Listening with your eyes -the lessons of &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Afterword&lt;br&gt;Notes&lt;br&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;br&gt;Index&lt;br&gt;Reading Group Guide&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate. This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail, and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a successful high-tech company, and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The $100 Startup&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Chris Guillebeau shows you how to lead a life of adventure, meaning and purpose – &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;earn a good living.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Still in his early thirties, Chris is on the verge of completing a tour of every country on earth – he’s already visited more than 175 nations – and yet he’s never held a “real job” or earned a regular paycheck.  Rather, he has a special genius for turning ideas into income, and he uses what he earns both to support his life of adventure and to give back.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; There are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;others &lt;/em&gt;like Chris – those who’ve found ways to opt out of traditional employment and create the time and income to pursue what they find meaningful.  Sometimes, achieving that perfect blend of passion and income doesn’t depend on shelving what you currently do.  You can start small with your venture, committing little time or money, and wait to take the real plunge when you're sure it's successful. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; In preparing to write this book, Chris identified 1,500 individuals who have built businesses earning $50,000 or more from a modest investment (in many cases, $100 or less), and from that group he’s chosen to focus on the 50 most intriguing case studies.  In nearly all cases, people with no special skills discovered aspects of their personal passions that could be monetized, and were able to restructure their lives in ways that gave them greater freedom and fulfillment.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Here, finally, distilled into one easy-to-use guide, are the most valuable lessons from those who’ve learned how to turn what they do into a gateway to self-fulfillment.  It’s all about finding the intersection between your “expertise” – even if you don’t consider it such -- and what other people will pay for.  You don’t need an MBA, a business plan or even employees.  All you need is a product or service that springs from what you love to do anyway, people willing to pay, and a way to get paid.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Not content to talk in generalities, Chris tells you exactly how many dollars his group of unexpected entrepreneurs required to get their projects up and running; what these individuals did in the first weeks and months to generate significant cash; some of the key mistakes they made along the way, and the crucial insights that made the business stick.  Among Chris’s key principles: if you’re good at one thing, you’re probably good at something else; never teach a man to fish – &lt;em&gt;sell&lt;/em&gt; him the fish instead; and in the battle between planning and action, action wins. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; In ancient times, people who were dissatisfied with their lives dreamed of finding magic lamps, buried treasure, or streets paved with gold.  Today, we know that it’s up to us to change our lives.  And the best part is, if we change our &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; life, we can help others change &lt;em&gt;theirs.&lt;/em&gt;  This remarkable book will start you on your way.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows that high IQ is no guarantee of success, happiness, or virtue, but until &lt;strong&gt;Emotional Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;, we could only guess why. Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our "two minds"—the rational and the emotional—and how they together shape our destiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through vivid examples, Goleman delineates the five crucial skills of emotional intelligence, and shows how they determine our success in relationships, work, and even our physical well-being. What emerges is an entirely new way to talk about being smart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best news is that "emotional literacy" is not fixed early in life. Every parent, every teacher, every business leader, and everyone interested in a more civil society, has a stake in this compelling vision of human possibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Presented in the form of a dialogue between Socrates and three different interlocutors, this classic text is an enquiry into the notion of a perfect community and the ideal individual within it. During the conversation, other questions are raised: what is goodness?; what is reality?; and what is knowledge? The Republic also addresses the purpose of education and the role of both women and men as guardians of the people. With remarkable lucidity and deft use of allegory, Plato arrives at a depiction of a state bound by harmony and ruled by philosopher kings.</description>

  <description>Revised and Expanded Edition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this age of supposed scientific enlightenment, many people still believe in mind reading, past-life regression theory, New Age hokum, and alien abduction. A no-holds-barred assault on popular superstitions and prejudices, with more than 80,000 copies in print, &lt;em&gt;Why People Believe Weird Things&lt;/em&gt; debunks these nonsensical claims and explores the very human reasons people find otherworldly phenomena, conspiracy theories, and cults so appealing. In an entirely new chapter, "Why &lt;em&gt;Smart&lt;/em&gt; People Believe in Weird Things," Michael Shermer takes on science luminaries like physicist Frank Tippler and others, who hide their spiritual beliefs behind the trappings of science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shermer, science historian and true crusader, also reveals the more dangerous side of such illogical thinking, including Holocaust denial, the recovered-memory movement, the satanic ritual abuse scare, and other modern crazes. &lt;em&gt;Why People Believe Strange Things&lt;/em&gt; is an eye-opening resource for the most gullible among us and those who want to protect them. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>From Andre Agassi, one of the most beloved athletes in history and one of the most gifted men ever to step onto a tennis court, a beautiful, haunting autobiography.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agassi’s incredibly rigorous training begins when he is just a child. By the age of thirteen, he is banished to a Florida tennis camp that feels like a prison camp. Lonely, scared, a ninth-grade dropout, he rebels in ways that will soon make him a 1980s icon. He dyes his hair, pierces his ears, dresses like a punk rocker. By the time he turns pro at sixteen, his new look promises to change tennis forever, as does his lightning-fast return. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet, despite his raw talent, he struggles early on. We feel his confusion as he loses to the world’s best, his greater confusion as he starts to win. After stumbling in three Grand Slam finals, Agassi shocks the world, and himself, by capturing the 1992 Wimbledon. Overnight he becomes a fan favorite and a media target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agassi brings a near-photographic memory to every pivotal match and every relationship. Never before has the inner game of tennis and the outer game of fame been so precisely limned. Alongside vivid portraits of rivals from several generations—Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer—Agassi gives unstinting accounts of his brief time with Barbra Streisand and his doomed marriage to Brooke Shields. He reveals a shattering loss of confidence. And he recounts his spectacular resurrection, a comeback climaxing with his epic run at the 1999 French Open and his march to become the oldest man ever ranked number one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In clear, taut prose, Agassi evokes his loyal brother, his wise coach, his gentle trainer, all the people who help him regain his balance and find love at last with Stefanie Graf. Inspired by her quiet strength, he fights through crippling pain from a deteriorating spine to remain a dangerous opponent in the twenty-first and final year of his career. Entering his last tournament in 2006, he’s hailed for completing a stunning metamorphosis, from nonconformist to elder statesman, from dropout to education advocate. And still he’s not done. At a U.S. Open for the ages, he makes a courageous last stand, then delivers one of the most stirring farewells ever heard in a sporting arena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With its breakneck tempo and raw candor, &lt;em&gt;Open &lt;/em&gt;will be read and cherished for years. A treat for ardent fans, it will also captivate readers who know nothing about tennis. Like Agassi’s game, it sets a new standard for grace, style, speed, and power.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From one of the world's leading thinkers and speakers on creativity and self-fulfillment, a breakthrough book about talent, passion, and achievement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The element is the point at which natural talent meets personal passion. When people arrive at the element, they feel most themselves and most inspired and achieve at their highest levels. &lt;em&gt;The Element&lt;/em&gt; draws on the stories of a wide range of people, from ex-Beatle Paul McCartney to Matt Groening, creator of &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;; from Meg Ryan to Gillian Lynne, who choreographed the Broadway productions of &lt;em&gt;Cats&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Phantom of the Opera&lt;/em&gt;; and from writer Arianna Huffington to renowned physicist Richard Feynman and others, including business leaders and athletes. It explores the components of this new paradigm: The diversity of intelligence, the power of imagination and creativity, and the importance of commitment to our own capabilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With a wry sense of humor, Ken Robinson looks at the conditions that enable us to find ourselves in the element and those that stifle that possibility. He shows that age and occupation are no barrier, and that once we have found our path we can help others to do so as well. &lt;em&gt;The Element&lt;/em&gt; shows the vital need to enhance creativity and innovation by thinking differently about human resources and imagination. It is also an essential strategy for transforming education, business, and communities to meet the challenges of living and succeeding in the twenty-first century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>From the author of the phenomenal New York Times bestseller, &lt;em&gt;Confessions of an Economic Hit Man&lt;/em&gt;, comes an exposé of international corruption, and an inspired plan to turn the tide for future generations&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a presidential election around the corner, questions of America's military buildup, environmental impact, and foreign policy are on everyone's mind. Former Economic Hit Man John Perkins goes behind the scenes of the current geopolitical crisis and offers bold solutions to our most pressing problems. Drawing on interviews with other EHMs, jackals, CIA operatives, reporters, businessmen, and activists, Perkins reveals the secret history of events that have created the current American Empire, including:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;How the defeats in Vietnam and Iraq have benefited big business&lt;br&gt;The role of Israel as Fortress America in the Middle East&lt;br&gt;Tragic repercussions of the IMF's Asian Economic Collapse&lt;br&gt;The current Latin American revolution and its lessons for democracy&lt;br&gt;U.S. blunders in Tibet, Congo, Lebanon, and Venezuela&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the U.S. military in Iraq to infrastructure development in Indonesia, from Peace Corps volunteers in Africa to jackals in Venezuela, Perkins exposes a conspiracy of corruption that has fueled instability and anti-Americanism around the globe, with consequences reflected in our daily headlines. Having raised the alarm, Perkins passionately addresses how Americans can work to create a more peaceful and stable world for future generations.&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>William Golding's compelling story about a group of very ordinary small boys marooned on a coral island has become a modern classic. At first, it seems as though it's all going to be great fun; but the fun before long becomes furious &amp;amp; life on the island turns into a nightmare of panic &amp;amp; death. As ordinary standards of behavior collapse, the whole world the boys know collapses with them—the world of cricket &amp;amp; homework &amp;amp; adventure stories—&amp;amp; another world is revealed beneath, primitive &amp;amp; terrible. &lt;strong&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/strong&gt; remains as provocative today as when it was 1st published in 1954, igniting passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. Though critically acclaimed, it was largely ignored upon its initial publication. Yet soon it became a cult favorite among both students and literary critics who compared it to J.D. Salinger's &lt;strong&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/strong&gt; in its influence on modern thought &amp;amp; literature. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, &lt;strong&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/strong&gt; has established itself as a classic.</description>

  <description>In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.</description>

  <description>In this hilarious and highly practical book, author and professional speaker Scott Berkun reveals the techniques behind what great communicators do, and shows how anyone can learn to use them well. For managers and teachers -- and anyone else who talks and expects someone to listen -- &lt;em&gt;Confessions of a Public Speaker&lt;/em&gt; provides an insider's perspective on how to effectively present ideas to anyone. It's a unique, entertaining, and instructional romp through the embarrassments and triumphs Scott has experienced over 15 years of speaking to crowds of all sizes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With lively lessons and surprising confessions, you'll get new insights into the art of persuasion -- as well as teaching, learning, and performance -- directly from a master of the trade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Highlights include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berkun's hard-won and simple philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;, culled from years of lectures, teaching courses, and hours of appearances on NPR, MSNBC, and CNBC&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical advice&lt;/strong&gt;, including how to work a tough room, the science of not boring people, how to survive the attack of the butterflies, and what to do when things go wrong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The inside scoop&lt;/strong&gt; on who earns $30,000 for a one-hour lecture and why&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The worst -- and funniest -- disaster stories&lt;/strong&gt; you've ever heard (plus countermoves you can use)&lt;br&gt;Filled with humorous and illuminating stories of thrilling performances and real-life disasters, &lt;em&gt;Confessions of a Public Speaker&lt;/em&gt; is inspirational, devastatingly honest, and a blast to read.</description>

  <description>THIS BOOK is for anyone who wants more online traffic, more revenue, more followers, more attention, more interest, more donations or more influence. The paradox, of course, is that the best way to get all these things is by delivering less.</description>

  <description>Most business books give you the same old advice: Write a business plan, study the competition, seek investors, yadda yadda. If you're looking for a book like that, put this one back on the shelf.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rework &lt;/em&gt;shows you a better, faster, easier way to succeed in business. Read it and you'll know why plans are actually harmful, why you don't need outside investors, and why you're better off ignoring the competition. The truth is, you need less than you think. You don't need to be a workaholic. You don't need to staff up. You don't need to waste time on paperwork or meetings. You don't even need an office. Those are all just excuses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; What you really need to do is stop talking and start working. This book shows you the way. You'll learn how to be more productive, how to get exposure without breaking the bank, and tons more counterintuitive ideas that will inspire and provoke you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With its straightforward language and easy-is-better approach, &lt;em&gt;Rework &lt;/em&gt;is the perfect playbook for anyone who’s ever dreamed of doing it on their own. Hardcore entrepreneurs, small-business owners, people stuck in day jobs they hate, victims of "downsizing," and artists who don’t want to starve anymore will all find valuable guidance in these pages.</description>

  <description>This book aims to firmly establish a common understanding that commercial banks create new money. There is no deeper mystery, and we must not allow our mind to be repelled. Only then can we properly address the much more significant question: Of all the possible alternative ways in which we could create new money and allocate purchasing power, is this really the best?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The book that sparked a marketing revolution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This is a subversive book. It says that the marketer is not--and ought not to be--at the center of successful marketing. The customer should be. Are you ready for that?" --From the Foreword by Malcolm Gladwell, author of &lt;em&gt;The Tipping Point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Counter to traditional marketing wisdom, which tries to count, measure, and manipulate the spread of information, Seth Godin argues that the information can spread most effectively from customer to customer, rather than from business to customer. Godin calls this powerful customer-to- customer dialogue the ideavirus, and cheerfully eggs marketers on to create an environment where their ideas can replicate and spread.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In lively detail, Godin looks at the ways companies such as PayPal, Hotmail, GeoCities, even Volkswagen have successfully launched ideaviruses. He offers a "recipe" for creating your own ideavirus, identifies the key factors in the successful spread of an ideavirus (powerful sneezers, hives, a clear vector, a smooth, friction-free transmission), and shows how any business, large or small, can use ideavirus marketing to succeed in a world that just doesn't want to hear it anymore from the traditional marketers.</description>

  <description>"The computer world is like an intellectual Wild West, in which you can shoot anyone you wish with your ideas, if you're willing to risk the consequences. " --from &lt;em&gt;Hackers &amp;amp; Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age&lt;/em&gt;, by Paul Graham&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are living in the computer age, in a world increasingly designed and engineered by computer programmers and software designers, by people who call themselves hackers. Who are these people, what motivates them, and why should you care?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consider these facts: Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car was not only designed on computers, but has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the Internet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hackers &amp;amp; Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age&lt;/em&gt;, by Paul Graham, explains this world and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers on an unflinching exploration into what he calls "an intellectual Wild West."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live. Topics include the importance of beauty in software design, how to make wealth, heresy and free speech, the programming language renaissance, the open-source movement, digital design, internet startups, and more.</description>

  <description>A young woman walks into a laboratory. Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketers at Procter &amp;amp; Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;They succeeded by transforming habits.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Power of Habit, &lt;/em&gt;award-winning &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;At its core, &lt;em&gt;The Power of Habit&lt;/em&gt; contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.</description>

  <description>Forget everything you thought you knew about how to motivate people—at work, at school, at home. It's wrong. As Daniel H. Pink (author of&lt;em&gt; To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others&lt;/em&gt;) explains in his paradigm-shattering book &lt;em&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt;, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does—and how that affects every aspect of our lives. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century, it's precisely the &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; way to motivate people for today's challenges. In &lt;em&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt;, he reveals the three elements of true motivation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;—the desire to direct our own lives&lt;br&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Mastery&lt;/strong&gt;—the urge to get better and better at something that matters&lt;br&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt; is bursting with big ideas—the rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Why do you do what you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers might have little in common, but they all &lt;em&gt;started with why&lt;/em&gt;. It was their natural ability to start with why that enabled them to inspire those around them and to achieve remarkable things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In studying the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world, Simon Sinek discovered that they all think, act, and communicate in the exact same way -- and it's the complete opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be lead, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Any organization can explain &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; it does; some can explain &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they do it; but very few can clearly articulate &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;. WHY is not money or profit-- those are always results. WHY does your organization exist? WHY does it do the things it does? WHY do customers really buy from one company or another? WHY are people loyal to some leaders, but not others? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Starting with WHY works in big business and small business, in the nonprofit world and in politics. Those who start with WHY never manipulate, they inspire. And the people who follow them don't do so because they have to; they follow because they want to. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Drawing on a wide range of real-life stories, Sinek weaves together a clear vision of what it truly takes to lead and inspire. This book is for anyone who wants to inspire others or who wants to find someone to inspire them.</description>

  <description>"Most [people] have the ridiculous notion that anything they do which produces an income is work — and that anything they do outside ‘working’ hours is play. There is no logic to that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[…]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your life is too short and too valuable to fritter away in work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you don’t get out now, you may end up like the frog that is placed in a pot of fresh water on the stove. As the temperature is gradually increased, the frog feels restless and uncomfortable, but not uncomfortable enough to jump out. Without being aware that a chance is taking place, he is gradually lulled into unconsciousness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much the same thing happens when you take a person and put him in a job which he does not like. He gets irritable in his groove. His duties soon become a monotonous routine that slowly dulls his senses. As I walk into offices, through factories and stores, I often find myself looking into the expressionless faces of people going through mechanical motions. They are people whose minds are stunned and slowly dying".</description>

  <description>A free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere: this is the goal of the Khan Academy, a passion project that grew from an ex-engineer and hedge funder's online tutoring sessions with his niece, who was struggling with algebra, into a worldwide phenomenon. Today millions of students, parents, and teachers use the Khan Academy's free videos and software, which have expanded to encompass nearly every conceivable subject; and Academy techniques are being employed with exciting results in a growing number of classrooms around the globe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like many innovators, Khan rethinks existing assumptions and imagines what education could be if freed from them. And his core idea-liberating teachers from lecturing and state-mandated calendars and opening up class time for truly human interaction-has become his life's passion. Schools seek his advice about connecting to students in a digital age, and people of all ages and backgrounds flock to the site to utilize this fresh approach to learning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE, Khan presents his radical vision for the future of education, as well as his own remarkable story, for the first time. In these pages, you will discover, among other things:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* How both students and teachers are being bound by a broken top-down model invented in Prussia two centuries ago&lt;br&gt;* Why technology will make classrooms more human and teachers more important&lt;br&gt;* How and why we can afford to pay educators the same as other professionals&lt;br&gt;* How we can bring creativity and true human interactivity back to learning&lt;br&gt;* Why we should be very optimistic about the future of learning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parents and politicians routinely bemoan the state of our education system. Statistics suggest we've fallen behind the rest of the world in literacy, math, and sciences. With a shrewd reading of history, Khan explains how this crisis presented itself, and why a return to "mastery learning," abandoned in the twentieth century and ingeniously revived by tools like the Khan Academy, could offer the best opportunity to level the playing field, and to give all of our children a world-class education now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than just a solution, THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE serves as a call for free, universal, global education, and an explanation of how Khan's simple yet revolutionary thinking can help achieve this inspiring goal.</description>

  <description>A tribe is any group of people, large or small, who are connected to one another, a leader, and an idea. For millions of years, humans have been seeking out tribes, be they religious, ethnic, economic, political, or even musical (think of the Deadheads). It's our nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the Internet has eliminated the barriers of geography, cost, and time. All those blogs and social networking sites are helping existing tribes get bigger. But more important, they're enabling countless new tribes to be born—groups of ten or ten thousand or ten million who care about their iPhones, or a political campaign, or a new way to fight global warming.&lt;br&gt;And so the key question: Who is going to lead us?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Web can do amazing things, but it can't provide leadership. That still has to come from individuals—people just like you who have passion about something. The explosion in tribes means that anyone who wants to make a difference now has the tools at her fingertips.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you think leadership is for other people, think again—leaders come in surprising packages. Consider Joel Spolsky and his international tribe of scary-smart software engineers. Or Gary Vaynerhuck, a wine expert with a devoted following of enthusiasts. Chris Sharma leads a tribe of rock climbers up impossible cliff faces, while Mich Mathews, a VP at Microsoft, runs her internal tribe of marketers from her cube in Seattle. All they have in common is the desire to change things, the ability to connect a tribe, and the willingness to lead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you ignore this opportunity, you risk turning into a "sheepwalker"—someone who fights to protect the status quo at all costs, never asking if obedience is doing you (or your organization) any good. Sheepwalkers don't do very well these days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tribes will make you think (really think) about the opportunities in leading your fellow employees, customers, investors, believers, hobbyists, or readers. . . . It's not easy, but it's easier than you think.&lt;br&gt; </description>
